This challenge is all the more formidable because ever since the end of thewar in 2009 in Sri Lanka, the ideology of the ruling regime reinforced ideas of Sinhala majoritarian supremacy and the suppression of minorities. It is in this context that we need to respond to the recent UN Human Rights Council Report on Sri Lanka and the resolution to which the current government is aco-sponsor.", "We, the undersigned, took different positions during the war fought between the Sri Lankan armed forces and the LTTE. Some of us were opposed to the war, while some of us were of the view that the LTTE had to be defeated militarily. However, whatever our differences on the war, we are of the view that the conduct of the Sri Lankan state after the end of the war and the military defeat of the LTTE in 2009 exacerbated existing ethnic tensions in the country. No war can claim to have been fought cleanly.", "All wars claim victims and leave losers. The latest UNHRC report documents with strong evidence the human rights violations that occurred during the last stages of the war. Even otherwise, our own observations and experiences provide evidence of the tremendous losses, suffering and trauma to which our fellow citizens, especially in the North and East were subject. The efforts especially by the last regime, to gloss over these losses have been the greatest barrier to national reconciliation. It created a situation where any attempt to acknowledge the loss and trauma of war and violence were depicted as 'anti-national', pro-terrorist and unpatriotic. It is time that these notions are once and for all put to rest. The Sri Lankan state which has claimed victory in this war, a war which we must remember was fought against its own citizens and was the result of historical failures in state-building, has an undeniable responsibility to respond to these instances of human rights violations.", "We are strongly of the view that it is therefore necessary to acknowledge the loss, suffering and trauma of this war. People who were subjected to human rights violations deserve to have their story heard and acknowledged. It is also noteworthy that this report documents human rights violations also in the South of the country.", "The grief and loss of those whose rights have been violated cannot simply be ignored or swept aside through the rhetoric of 'defeating terrorism' and 'protecting the sovereignty of the country'. Attempts by certain groups, individuals and the media to portray this report as 'anti Sri Lanka' are particularly disturbing since it suggests that some Sri Lankan citizens are less worthy or more expendable than others. It is for this reason that we strongly oppose attempts to undermine investigations into human rights violations during the war and to hold accountable those who were responsible for such violations. We find attempts to frame such interventions as 'Western conspiracies', attacks on sovereignty and insulting to 'war heroes' as particularly damaging towards reconciliation and healing. We would like to draw the attention of everyone, especially those who are resisting current efforts to investigate human rights violations, to Sri Lanka's international obligations to uphold human rights of all its citizens. We therefore call upon the Sri Lankan government, all political parties, the UN and other international bodies and sponsors of the UNHRC resolution to place the needs and concerns of those who suffered during the war at the forefront of any mechanisms that will be put in place in the future.", "This relates not only to their protection, but also that their psychosocial needs and well-being should drive the investigation and accountability process. We must also ensure those who have suffered human rights violations do not get 're-traumatised' through this endeavour and that psychosocial support for those who need it is provided before, during and after the process. In this regard we emphasize that what is required is not simply a judicial process or a punitive process of investigation and punishment, but a process that will consider and respond to all the different needs of those who have been affected by the war such as their material, emotional and social protection needs. This means approaching the issue of justice from the broadest possible perspective.", "We strongly urge all parties involved to desist from efforts to use the suffering and trauma of these people for engaging in political grandstanding. We also urge the Sri Lankan state and the UN to ensure that the process of accountability is made meaningful for the victims of war and not simply as an exercise in image building for any individual, group or organisation.", "It is in this context, that we are especially concerned that the process for investigation and accountability that is undertaken is independent and legitimate. Given the serious erosion of judicial independence in Sri Lanka in recent times, we are of the opinion that a purely domestic process cannot ensure justice or inspire confidence especially among the affected people.", "Neither do we think that the mere presence of international actors can ensure this. We call upon all those responsible to learn from similar processes in countries such as South Africa and Cambodia and to apply those lessons to the processes and institutions that are to be established in Sri Lanka.", "We reiterate that how we deal with the human rights violations during the wars could be the single most meaningful intervention towards the all important and badly needed task of reconciliation, healing and rebuilding our country as one which is truly democratic, inclusive and pluralistic.", "Without acknowledging our past wrongdoing we will be unable to move forward as a country and society.", "\u00a0"]},

The recently retired Wilkinson is famous for his meticulous pre-kicking routine which included grasping his hands together and raising them up to his chest. Wilkinson's sequence has been mimicked ever since but Welshman Dan Biggar has taken it to a new level. The match-winner against England when he nailed a penalty goal from halfway in Wales' 28-25 win last Sunday, Biggar's pre-kick routine was tagged as the \"Biggarena\" by London's Daily Telegraph.

It's a deliberate act but Hansen won't say if it's a superstition or a signal.

He has a similar \"tic\" to Hansen in that he touches his ear during the singing of England's national anthem ahead of matches. It was originally intended as a way of sending a visual message to his family, watching from home. But the routine is now a ritual for Catt.", "The unpredictable Aussie winger had one noticeable foible. He had to be the last player to run out on the pitch in any game he played. Leaving the dressing room last seemed to work well for 'Campo' but it did blow up in 1996 at Wellington's Athletic Park when he turned his back on the haka, kicking a ball to himself under the goalposts. The All Blacks were unimpressed, with Jonah Lomu running rampant as New Zealand racked up a 43-6 scoreline in the last test ever played at the famous ground in the capital.", "The World Cup-winning All Black loosie from the 1987 squad was surprisingly superstitious in his playing days. \"I used to have a little ritual in the changing shed,\" Whetton said. \"I would put the jersey on a peg by itself - it would command a lot of respect. So I would look at it. I used to have my togs, boots and mouthguard in a bag below - they didn't quite warrant being together with the shirt.

I used to pat the grass thinking: 'That could be AJ's spot.'\"", "The World Cup-winning Springbok skipper of 2007 has a dark secret - and one loosely associated with the All Blacks.

The island nation has therefore sought to reap the benefits of the great power competition, and the three nations have had to adjust their engagement accordingly.", "The leadership of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa favoured China, while the new President Maithripala Sirisena has opened the country up for re-engagement with India and the United States. After winning the parliamentary elections in August, the new government reaffirmed Sri Lanka's new foreign policy direction, returning to the traditional practice of parliamentary democracy and renewed better relations with India and the United States. Nonetheless, what might seem to play out as deteriorating China ties in favour of stronger relations with India and the United States is much more than that: it is the manifestation of a delicate, non-aligned foreign policy.", "As India and China are becoming more reliant on energy imports, the two countries \"share an interest\" with the United States in safeguarding the commercial sea routes on the Indian Ocean, which host one-third of the planet's population as well as vast resource supplies, and through which an overwhelming proportion of the global container and oil traffic ships transit.", "With this background and historical context, Sri Lanka has become central to the dynamics of the relationship between India, China, and the United States, as all of these countries have strategic interests connected to the island nation.", "Sri Lanka has been anything but helpless in these circumstances. The Rajapaksa regime's foreign policy engagement, dubbed the \"Colombo Consensus\", was deeply influenced by the brutal civil war fought between the government forces and the Tamil Tigers. The bloody victory of the Rajapaksa leadership ensured a wide range of internal support, but it limited the space for engagement with foreign powers.", "First, U.S.-Sri Lankan ties were severed as the Rajapaksa government was subject to criticism of alleged war crimes, human rights abuses, corruption, and nepotism. With the backing of the United States, the UN Human Rights Council requested an investigation into wartime wrongdoings, provoking a negative response from Sri Lanka.", "Second, the cultural bonds between the Tamil populations on both sides of the Palk Strait heavily influenced India's engagement with the island, as New Delhi needed to satisfy the politically influential parties of the Tamil Nadu state of India without endangering cordial relations with the Sri Lankan government.", "The restricted engagement of the United States and India opened up the space for China's pragmatic approach, which was not hindered by grievances over wartime atrocity claims, human rights and corruption. As Beijing's strategic interest is to maintain the security of its economic lifeline in the Indian Ocean, it started to build an extensive network of maritime facilities in the region. This plan, known as the \"String of Pearls\" strategy, is seen by India as an effort to \"concircle\" New Delhi. As the Rajapaksa regime offered advantageous conditions for infrastructural development, Beijing's push for massive investment projects-including the controversial Hambantota Port-provided justification for an increased Chinese naval presence in the region.", "More recently, Colombo is an important stopover for Beijing's 21st Century Maritime Silk Road-the sea-based pillar of the \"One Belt-One Road\" initiative-which shows a striking parallel to the String of Pearls. Sri Lanka, under the Sirisena administration, has been eager to support China's projects, which might give further basis for maintaining Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean region. Observers now regard last year's port visits of Chinese warships in Colombo as being inconsistent with Beijing's supposed \"Peaceful Rise\" strategy, making India and the United States increasingly worried.", "Ultimately, the rule of the Rajapaksa regime, marked by allegations of oppression, nepotism and authoritarianism, benefited Beijing, which used its leverage to gain a strategic foothold in the Indian Ocean region.", "It seems that this foreign policy trajectory was significantly altered by a karmic self-correction for freedom. Motivated by decreasing popularity, Rajapaksa called for a snap election and was dethroned by his former ally Sirisena, who promised to tackle corruption and nepotism and create a more balanced foreign policy with parliamentary democracy under the shared power of the presidency. Furthermore, Rajapaksa's recent failure to become prime minister during the general elections gives the island nation a chance to maintain its new foreign policy direction.", "These developments seem to be advantageous for New Delhi. Sirisena visited India on his first overseas trip and wrapped up a consequential meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, resulting in four agreements, including a civil nuclear collaboration pact. Later, as a part of India's push for a more comprehensive Indian Ocean policy, Modi visited Sri Lanka during his Indian Ocean tour. Partly motivated by military and resource security issues, during this visit, India pledged to assist Colombo in developing the Upper Tank Farm at China Bay and transform Trincomalee into a \"regional petroleum hub\". The adjacent Trincomalee's natural harbour is a regular refueling stop for U.S. naval vessels.", "The recent leadership changes have been welcomed by the United States. The press labeled the development as \"good news for democracy,\" and during Secretary of State John Kerry's visit, the United States pledged to provide assistance to Sri Lanka's reforms, anti-corruption initiatives, and investigation into undeclared and hidden foreign assets by Rajapaksa's family members and other officials. Moreover, bilateral relations seem to be continuing to improve further as Washington recently abandoned its former stance on the inquiry of alleged wartime atrocities, favouring Sri Lanka's domestic investigation over an international probe by the United Nations.", "In the wake of the recent developments, it seems that understanding the internal dynamics of Sri Lanka and trying to shape them is more beneficial than an external, no-strings-attached approach of pouring money into the country. Chinese investments, including the $1.5 billion Colombo project, have become targets of scrutiny. Regarding the docking of Chinese submarines, the new leadership has clearly stated that it will avoid such episodes in the future. Moreover, Sirisena publicly downplayed the Maritime Silk Road during his speech given at China's Boao Forum in Hainan.", "It might be tempting to conclude that the recent changes have brought a 180-degree turn in Sri Lanka's international trajectory, but this would be premature. First of all, senior officials of the government were keen to articulate that the Sino-Lankan relations did not suffer a setback, nor did they lose their importance. Second, China's loans might have been suspended, but the new government does not intend to revoke them, and there are new negotiations involving China-funded initiatives. Furthermore, China appears to be devoted to maintaining cordial relations with the new leadership, as Beijing rewarded Sirisena with a $100 million specialized hospital for his home district to treat a mysterious kidney disease afflicting farmers. Finally, the Sirisena government has maintained strategic engagement with China, as the two sides successfully conducted a joint military exercise in July.", "Given the growing importance of the maritime trade routes of the Indian Ocean and its strategic location next to them, Sri Lanka has to shape its foreign policy against the backdrop of strategic competition between China, India, and the United States. Emerging from a bloody civil war, the international reputation of the Rajapaksa regime provided narrow space for manoeuvre, drifting the island toward robust Chinese influence. Nevertheless, the unexpected presidential change and the general election results have shown that the country was far from sealing its own fate.", "Sirisena has initiated a clear recalibration of foreign policy, shaping the former China-inclination toward a more equidistant engagement with India and the United States. However, even the modest results of the Sirisena regime to date might be in danger if the new government fails to pursue a more non-aligned but engaged foreign policy, while fulfilling its campaign promises to the Sri Lankan people. Otherwise, a new karmic cycle may decide once again the fate of the democratic island nation."]},

At least did they pay for the resources of Lankan people that they used? In the middle of these campaigns of people for democracy, pro fascistic movement is once again preparing to raise the battle on the Geneva based discussions, connected to the problem of war crimes in Lanka. Democratic leaders believe that there is an umbrella issue covering all, namely the problem of finding a solution to the Tamil national problem.", "Some people believe that global powers including India are using the threat of war crimes investigations to promote a political solution to the national problem. It is an imperialist conspiracy but meant to serve the best interests of both Lanka and India!", "Global powers were enthusiastic for an international war crimes investigation. However, now together with the Lankan Government, they favour purely domestic process. Clearly, the mass uprising in Lanka for democracy has opened the eyes of global powers. They had to admit, though they supported Mahinda regime there wasn't the slightest prospect of a political solution, whereas there is now at least a reasonable prospect for it. Still, one can argue that the threat of an international war crimes investigation was meant to propel the Lankan Government towards a political solution. That is to give much benevolence to global masters.", "It is more likely that they have opted to accept the democratic revolution, in order to keep it within their folds. Their method of intervention now comes under the support given to arrive at a solution to the Tamil national problem! The Tamil leaders may be very happy but the history tells us that global capitalism intervenes to give less democracy to the oppressed. It is better to accept help with concern and suspicion.", "People have to be twice concerned, because there has been a change in the Indian leadership in the recent times. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a much tougher Hinduthva character than Man Mohan Singh, a western educated rationalist gentleman.", "During his visit to Lanka Prime Minister Modi outspokenly advocated federalism, to show his sympathy to Federal party leaders and their struggle. Furthermore, it is claimed, unlike the Congress leaders from the time of Nehru that respected Buddhism as the apex of Hindu religion, Modi as a devotee of the ideology of Hindutva, went out of the way to affirm the Hindu commonality of the Lankan Tamils and the Hindus of India. Of course it is natural, for people of same culture and ideology to come together and claim same identity.", "Nobody could complain about Hindus in the Indian subcontinent getting together with a commonality; or about the common identity of Tamils in the sub continent.

Nearly 35 years later, it seems a different world. A way of life has died between then and now. It is through these multiple layers of life and memories that I remember that evening.", "It was nearly dusk when the news spread through Jaffna 'Principal Anandarajan shot dead' and then the other three words followed in a hushed tone, like a reluctant trailer, '.... by the boys'.", "I first met Anandarajan when I was 14 years, a few weeks before I was to join St John's. Anandarajan was introduced to me at a family function, as my would be principal. The first thing I noticed about him was the total lack of aloofness. His response was 'I say, I was a classmate of your mother at St John's, and she was the only girl in the class whom I was sacred of (which my mother vehemently denied!).", "In the years that followed I came to know Anandarajan more closely, first as a teacher, and then as a close family friend. In those days at St John's the first year Advanced Level classes occupied the open sheds opposite the Vice Principal's house, and everyday from my classroom I would see Anandarajan walk purposefully across the school grounds from his residence to the principal's office.", "If it was a Monday, I would see him again a few minutes later, wearing a black academic-gown walking up the stage of Peto Hall to chair the assembly. I used to enjoy those Monday morning assemblies, as they provided a welcome reprieve from the stress of cramming for exams. Anandarajan would invite interesting speakers to address us, from Hindu mystics to those who spoke on more earthy topics such as pollution and war in the Middle East. Ironically for many of us in those days, war was something that happened only in distant places. If there were no outside speakers, Anandarajan would address the assembly himself.", "It was on one such occasions that I learnt a value that I have cherished ever since then. It is in Anandarajan's own words: \"Always defend yourself. Never let anyone accuse you falsely - not anyone - not even me. If you let that happen, part of the blame is yours\".", "In those days living as a teenager in Jaffna was not easy. Most of our time was spent running from one tuition class to another. It was as if one's inherent value depended solely on one's Advanced Level results. On many occasions I have heard Anandarajan speak worriedly about this disturbing tendency. He often advised us to view education more widely, as preparation for life, rather than as a preparation for exams.", "In 1981 a public meeting was held at the Jaffna Open Air Theatre to talk about problems facing students in Jaffna and Anandarajan was one of the speakers. In his speech, he remarked somewhat humorously: \"In the 20 odd years that I have been a teacher in Jaffna, I have only seen two things grow in number - Funeral Parlours and Private Tutories.\" Looking back, what he said seems almost prophetic, given the barrenness that would descend upon Jaffna in the next few years.", "In his novel, When Memory Dies, author A Sivanandan speaks of two types of teachers. The first one imparts knowledge. They pull you through exams and help you get qualified, get good jobs and do well in life etc. The second type are ones who influence the kind of person you become. Many who went to St John's would testify that Anandarajan fell into the latter.", "Soon after Anandarajan was murdered, a number of loose reasons were given to justify his killing. Some of them were laughably ridiculous. One of them was that he raised the boundary wall of the school to obstruct militants running away after attacking the army. It is true that high walls would have prevented the free moment of militants, but anyone who is familiar with densely built up Chundikuli would know that high walls are more the norm than the exception in the area around St John's. It was more likely that he raised the wall to protect the students in the school.", "The more serious accusation was that Anandarajan took the St. John's cricket team to play a match against a Sri Lankan army team based in Jaffna. But many fail to realise that this was during a ceasefire, when the leaders of the LTTE themselves were engaged in talks with the Sri Lankan government. It is alleged that the Sri Lankan Army committed many crimes, both before and after this particular match. But playing a match with someone does not amount to absolving someone of their alleged crimes. It is perhaps just a gesture of reconciliation, in the hope that there would be peace as a result of the talks in Bhutan, a hope that many Tamils cherished at the time.", "In the Orwellian drama of shifting alliances and enmities that played out during the following decades, the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government would warm up in many more intimacies of a much closer kind, including LTTE leaders being entertained in five-star hotels in Colombo and being flown around in Air Force helicopters, probably piloted by the same pilots who flew them in strafing missions over Tamil areas.", "During the time I knew Anandarajan, I had many disagreements with him on a number of issues. No two serious minded people can agree on everything, nor should they be forced to do so. Had our association been allowed to continue, we might have continued to debate these differences. But there is a world of difference between resolving differences through debate and seeking to resolve them through violence. I think that at some point in history, humanity crossed that chasm, but in Sri Lanka we have let ourselves slide back behind that line again. We need to recover from this position, if we are ever to become a modern nation.", "The LTTE allegedly killed Anandarajan but the LTTE does not exist anymore. However, the lessons to be learnt from this does not apply only to the LTTE or the Tamils. Authoritarianism is too common everywhere in Sri Lanka. We saw it in the late 1980s in the south, we saw it throughout the war in the North and East, and we saw it rise in the post war years. The lesson to be learnt is that whenever we allow power to go unchecked, society declines. It is ultimately the responsibility of the people to make sure that those who represent us are held accountable. We cannot let go of this responsibility and expect to come out in one piece.", "Finally allow me to end this with a personal note. It may appear strange to some that I write this appreciation, as two years after Anandarajan was killed, my father was also allegedly killed by the Sri Lankan Army. The tragedy of war struck deep into my own family. If any, my writing this reveals just one thing, which is that the saddest but also most poignant truth facing Sri Lanka today is that after three decades of war, in pursuit of something or the other, Sri Lanka is divided only along one line. It is the line between those who suffered and those who inflicted that suffering. Six years after the end of the war, this is the only dividing line that matters, and it is the only dividing line that we should permit to matter, if we are to pursue reconciliation with honesty.", "On October 3 this year, 30 years after Anandarajan's death, the inaugural Anandarajan Memorial Lecture will be delivered at the Peto Memorial Hall at St John's College, Jaffna. It is a public lecture open to all and will be delivered by Dr Daya Somasundaram. The inauguration of this lecture is a sign that intellectual life and free discussion are slowly returning to Jaffna, after decades of war and totalitarianism. While celebrating this, it is also a good time to remember C E Anandarajan and what happened to him, as we should remember all those who died in the war and the suffering inflicted, the only legacies of a long and pointless war.", "Beatrice, fondly known as Beta was my close confidant and comrade, a much loved, unpretentious pal of the family as well. My close association with unassuming Beta grew fonder over the years as I began to cherish our invaluable bond of friendship: A friend who will indeed remain simply unforgettable.", "Reminiscing the past, and penning a six month memorial after Beta's demise, I was stricken with sentiments of despondency, for Beta had assuredly left a vacuum in our friendship. Amidst her busy schedule, Beta was someone who always kept in touch and impacted everyone who came into her life.", "Much admired for her great intimacy with the Lord Jesus Christ, Beta truly portrayed a godly charisma which magnetized the broken - hearted. A pillar of strength to the weak and weary,Beta was essentially an adorable, vivacious, petite buddy who attracted people and left an indelible mark on their lives.", "Possessing an inner beauty of a quiet and gentle spirit, Beta had divine competency to change even the most trying person and challenging situations in life. Opposition or rejection was no challenge to her. Her attitude astounded me many a time. I truly witnessed Beta's ability to overcome anything and everything with a smile and without much ado. She was an epitome of love and patience and truly virtuous indeed.", "Absolutely amazing, witty and humorous, it was such fun to be in Beta's attendance especially when she chose to narrate her funny stories of yester-year, with a conspicuous impish smile she would hold her audience in fits of laughter. I recall her last visit to my home just three days before she went to be with the Lord. All Beta said was that all she wanted to to thank God for all He has been to her and her family.", "After her passing away, I was more than convinced that Beta was going to meet her 'Maker' and Lord and Saviour soon for sure, for she was indeed a great woman of God, an excellent wife to her precious husband Bala and an extraordinary mum to her beautiful God-fearing daughters Sonali and Minoli.", "A loss of an exceptional wife, and amazing mother and an incredible friend in Christ who fought a good fight, finished her race, kept the faith and won herself an imperishable crown which we here on earth should earnestly desire. I will always treasure Beta's friendship and remember for her unique qualities and she will truly be my comrade forever more.", "Two weeks ago when our dear friend Hamid Abdul Kareem came home in the night to tell me that he had decided to go on the Hajj pilgrimage together with his wife, I was pleased that he has planned to get closer to the Almighty Creator Allah.", "However, neither Hamid nor I realized that Allah was waiting to take Hamid to Him from the most sacred soil for Muslims in this planet. Hamid died of heart failure on his way from Azeezia to Mina on September 26 and was buried in Makka on the following day-Sunday- after noon prayers.", "Hamid was lucky as this is the death that every sincere Muslim longs for. It was a shock to his family, friends and the community who find it difficult to recover from the abrupt loss of one of the finest human beings committed to help others.", "Hamid, a colourful person with a great sense of humour, was known for turning even the most serious atmosphere during discussions into a humorous one.", "He spent his life helping others from his early days. It was this tendency that made him a founder of the Centre for Islamic Studies and his deep involvement in the Al Amal International School, to name a few.", "He served as the joint secretary of the Sri Lanka Committee for Solidarity with Palestinian People. There, he was very passionate in defending the rights of Palestinians and highlighting the atrocities of Zionist Jews towards Palestinians and the Arabs in the region as well.", "He was known for his in-depth knowledge in Palestinian-Israeli conflict. As a well-read person, he contributed a great deal with his writing to promote the true spirit of Islam and creating understanding between people of different faiths. As part of this program, Hamid, known for his unassuming and simple lifestyle, used do discuss Islam and Christianity with theologians and others of different faiths.", "Despite all his scholarly background, Hamid, born into a well-known business family, remained a businessman till his last day. Once when I asked him how was a Memon like him from a business oriented community, so much involved in scholarly activities. His response in his own sarcastic manner was: \"If you ask a Memon whether he likes to go to heaven or hell, his immediate response would be 'wherever I can make some money'.", "Hamid was a journalist with a cause and conviction - a generation which is fast fading under the commercialized and criminalized global political - economic environment. He fearlessly used his pen to fight for justice. This earned him the respect of all alike. Unfortunately, Sri Lanka's Muslim community which, by and large, does not understand the power of the media, failed to make better use of him.", "May Allah forgive his sins, accept his deeds and grant him Jannathul Firdouse.

The resolution on Sri Lanka titled 'Promoting Reconciliation, Accountability and Human Rights in Sri Lanka' was co-sponsored by Sri Lanka and 25 additional co-sponsors.", "This is a far cry from the days when Sri Lanka was seen as an international outcast, with the Government of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa engaged in various theatrics at home in the name of defending the country's sovereignty. The truth was that international opinion was soundly against Sri Lanka on the matter of accountability following the ending of the war in May 2009.", "Ironically, Rajapaksa himself was responsible for this predicament, because he basically came to an agreement with the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to probe any violations of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) which may have occurred in the final days of the war, following the latter's tour of the North almost immediately after the guns fell silent.", "However, his Government evaded the issue and repeated a series of lies to the International Community (IC) that compounded the problem. For example, by the time the Government finally admitted that civilian casualties occurred during the war due to whatever circumstances, it was too late. The Government had ample time to commence a local investigation on this matter as suggested by the IC, but it did not. Worse, it castigated leading officials of the UN, including the previous Human Rights Commissioner Navi Pillay, who was accused of siding with the LTTE and the Tamil Diaspora because she was of Tamil descent. This did not go down well with most countries, including countries which were generally supportive of Sri Lanka.", "The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) was a belated response to the pressure from the UN and the IC, but the Government did not have the political will to implement even a few of its recommendations. On the contrary, it brazenly stifled certain rights of the minority communities, such as singing the National Anthem in Tamil. The IC had absolutely no faith in the Rajapaksa Government that it would initiate a local investigation on IHL violations - hence, there were growing calls for an international mechanism. This threat hung like the proverbial Sword of Damocles on the country, with the threat of crippling economic sanctions in the offing.", "Fortunately, the new Government that took over the country's reins on January 8, 2015 (and whose mandate was strengthened on August 17), took the far more pragmatic course of engaging constructively with the UN and the IC on this issue, particularly countries such as the USA and UK which the Rajapaksa administration saw as \"hostile\" nations. Following intense negotiations, it managed to get the presentation of the resolution on Sri Lanka to September from March.", "In the meantime, by passing the 19th Amendment, the Government demonstrated its commitment to an independent judiciary, police service and to democracy in the wider sense of the word. In other words, this indicated that Sri Lanka's domestic institutions and mechanisms were finally ready to do justice to a local investigation on the issue of alleged IHL violations by both parties to the conflict.", "The reworked resolution reflects this stance and Sri Lanka itself had no issue with co-sponsoring the resolution which envisages the establishment of a local judicial mechanism to investigate allegations of human rights violations and abuses. The proposed mechanism will obtain support from international experts, when necessary. Apart from the steps already taken by the Government, the resolution encourages the government to bring in necessary reforms to the country's domestic law to ensure that Sri Lanka can effectively implement its commitments.", "All right thinking Sri Lankans will heave a sigh of relief at this outcome, although a few cardboard heroes are likely to describe it as an \"international conspiracy to destabilize Sri Lanka\". The stark reality is that as a member of the UN, we cannot evade certain responsibilities which we are bound to uphold as per accepted international conventions on human rights and IHL. Furthermore, a proper domestic inquiry will help clear the good name of our Security Forces and other agencies that participated in the war effort.

Though the final resolution was not available at the time of writing this article, a wide debate has opened in the country over the draft resolution that was to be adopted with amendments. This is natural. Though the debate has ended in Geneva it is likely to have its repercussions here and abroad for a long time.", "Already opinion is divided over the domestic mechanism that would investigate the human rights violations that were supposed to have taken place during the last phase of the war. Some see it as a trap to strangle the country. For some others it is an excuse to whitewash the whole issue. Still others consider it a necessity step to solve the problems confronting the country at present.", "Though this matter relates to the last phase of the war it is necessary to go back in history to a period considerably earlier. War is nothing but the continuation of politics by other means. The war erupted since that politics could not be continued under normal peaceful conditions. Here the turning point was the Black July of 1983 when a mass pogrom against the Sri Lankan Tamil population took place with the connivance of the Government then in power.", "Internationalization of the National Question in Sri Lanka was a direct consequence of Black July, following which there was a large exodus of Tamils to foreign lands, principally to India and Western countries. It created a huge Tamil Diaspora most of whom subsequently obtained citizenship of the West. As a result these countries began to be involved in domestic affairs of Sri Lanka, principally in inter-communal relations and the human rights situation here. It is plain that we ourselves are to blame for this internationalization of a problem which remained absolutely a domestic one beforehand.", "No country could be isolated in today's globalized world. Also the world is more alert with regard to human rights violations anywhere in the world. Just as we are concerned about the human rights of Palestinians or Black Americans or Aboriginal communities elsewhere the world is concerned about the rights of the Sri Lankan population, especially of the Tamil population.", "During the latter part of the Eelam War Sri Lanka became isolated in the world due to two factors. One was the rabid chauvinist policy vigorously pursued by the Government in the name of patriotism and the antagonistic policies it pursued against countries which had a considerable Tamil Diaspora of Sri Lankan origin. Incidentally this is the type of patriotism that Bertrand Russel spoke of when he said that patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.", "The demand for an international inquiry to investigate alleged human rights violations during the concluding phase of the war was a political reaction to the immature and unenlightened domestic and foreign policies of the former Government. It should also be remembered that it also did not emerge overnight. They first demanded a credible domestic inquiry. In deed it was promised. But the promise was never kept. Though at last the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission was established its report was not implemented. In the meantime the former President agreed with the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to allow an international inquiry. One this is evident. We have promised an international inquiry. We have lost our credibility among the world community of nations since we reneged on that promise.", "Another important factor is the change in the international community's attitude towards Sri Lanka following the Presidential election and the positive changes taken by the new government to create a climate more conducive for national reconciliation. They have also noted the remarkable change for the better in the human rights situation and steps taken towards good governance albeit against stiff opposition from reactionary forces. The result has been the ending of Sri Lanka's isolation in the world.", "The retreat of the international community from an international inquiry to a hybrid and then domestic inquiry is a result of the political developments in Sri Lanka since January. This has somewhat reduced the threats to our sovereignty. It is only somewhat and not total for total elimination of the threat depends on our own conduct.", "For example, our sovereignty would be certainly in danger if we reject outright the demand for a domestic inquiry. We have to admit that there human rights violations may have occurred during the war. When they are violated even in ordinary non-political confrontations how can we offhand deny that there were never any such violations?", "On the other hand, a refusal to investigate betrays a guilty consciousness on our part. Our politicians and officials have so far behaved in that way. Whatever inquiry that is held should be fair and independent. It should not be a trick to get out of an embarrassing situation. Such a course of action would have the same result as rejection of an inquiry.", "Though the request for an inquiry has come from the international community the inquiry is actually an imperative domestic need for it is a sine qua non for national reconciliation and sustainable peace. Its need is therefore more ours. Elated at the decision of the Human Rights Council to opt for a domestic inquiry some spokesmen of the Government has begun boasting that everything is OK as if there is nothing more to worry about. Everything will be OK only if inquiries are conducted properly and fairly, If not the international community may change its attitude again. We have to remember that lost credibility cannot be regained by words alone.", "Since the defects in our judicial system are acknowledged it is essential that some form of international intervention may be needed for the domestic inquiry. The task will be to select the form of intervention that would not compromise State sovereignty. There may be persons in any social organism that violate ordinary norms of conduct. We find such persons among teachers, lawyers, doctors, politicians, priests etc. Then how could one say that Black Sheep are not found among members of the Security Forces? If there are such persons investigating and punishing the guilty would certainly enhance the prestige of the Security Forces. The Tamil National Alliance in a statement on the draft resolution of the Human Rights Council has expressed its willingness to cooperate with the Government. This is a welcome positive development. In its opinion the domestic inquiry is a constructive first step in a long journey towards national reconciliation.", "However there are several obstacles to be cleared to effectively proceed towards national reconciliation. The first is the need to overcome the resistance of the chauvinist forces who are trying to use the HRC Resolution to regain power. Their strength should not be under-estimated. They thrive on the ignorance of the public and use pseudo-patriotic slogans to foster racial hatred. Also one should be mindful of opportunist forces within the ranks of the Government itself who may again desert it and join the opposition at critical times. A repetition of the serial drama enacted by the opposition during the January-August period may occur.", "The best guarantee against such a possibility is to take the people into confidence and ensure transparency and openness in all government undertakings. The necessity of organising the masses in favour of a political solution to the National Question is an urgent necessity if Sri Lanka is to make good use of the new space available for national reconciliation and a just peace.\u00a0"]},

But when it first went out on BBC1 on 24 September 1995 no one guessed it would change the TV landscape.", "It was the year of The Spice Girls and Robbie Williams.

Although any thoughts about the transparent effects on a white voile shirt were never mentioned at the time!\u2019", "The adaptation was the brainchild of producer Sue Birtwistle, who got screenwriter Andrew Davies on board by cleverly telling him the book was about sex, money and social climbing. Together they hatched a plot to make their version young and contemporary.", "\u2018It was very innovative for its time,\u2019 says Andrew, who wrote scenes set in the Bennet girls\u2019 bedrooms or showing people getting dressed or taking a bath. \u2018There was very much a kind of young, physical, funny, sexy vibe to it. And maybe that\u2019s why people still love it.\u2019", "Jane Austen\u2019s world is very female, but Andrew wanted to put men at the heart of the drama. Thus the series opened with horseback scenes. Later Darcy was seen fencing with Bingley and, of course, swimming in the lake at Pemberley. Andrew still regrets that Darcy didn\u2019t dive in naked.", "\u2018It was about Nature with a capital N. Darcy had been spending too much time being polite in London with a group of stuffy people. But at the centre of his essence he was just a man, almost like a wild creature, who saw his lake there and thought, \u201cLet\u2019s get into this different element where I don\u2019t have to be polite or worry about my tenants. I can just be a man.\u201d\u2019", "Much to the writer\u2019s disappointment, a white shirt was produced to preserve Darcy\u2019s modesty as he emerged from the lake to encounter Elizabeth Bennet. But actually this just made the scene hotter for many female viewers. Even Andrew was astonished. \u2018What was intended to be a comic scene of social embarrassment \u2013 having to have a polite conversation while ignoring the fact that one of them was soaking wet \u2013 became something quite different.\u2019 But Colin, then 33, brought something very special to the role. On set his fellow actors were mesmerised by the way he could convey so much by apparently doing so little.", "In fact the first scene Colin and Jennifer had to shoot was the proposal scene where Lizzy turns him down. They barely knew each other but Colin nailed it, says Adrian Lukis, who played dastardly Army officer Mr Wickham.", "\u2018Even as a young man, Colin had a real strength to his personality, whereas most people in their youth are flying around like headless chickens trying to find out who they are, particularly actors.\u2019", "Colin himself later explained that the stress of shooting the proposal scene brought an unexpected chemistry between himself and Jennifer Ehle.", "\u2018Because it\u2019s so inappropriate to do that early and it\u2019s so nerve-racking, we gave it a tremendous amount of attention and got a degree of adrenaline working up to it, so it was invested with something it would never have had if we\u2019d done it later, when everyone had settled in. It was jumping in at the deep end,\u2019 he said. Their subsequent real-life romance is testimony to that. With five Bennet girls to cast, director Simon Langton ended up seeing just about every actress between 15 and 28. It was quite a challenge to find people who had the wit and charisma to do the script justice, as well as the right period air.", "\u2018Elizabeth Bennet had to have sex appeal because we\u2019d be watching her for a total of six hours,\u2019 says Simon. \u2018It doesn\u2019t mean she had to look like a goddess, quite the opposite sometimes, but I knew Jennifer definitely had it.

She hit the bull\u2019s eye every time. I don\u2019t mean she was complacent. She was just fully formed. I was mesmerised by her, everybody was. And Colin was a hoot, very funny and adorable.\u2019", "The drama enhanced the careers of a generation of young actresses, including Susannah Harker as Jane Bennet (her mother Polly Adams had played Jane in the 1967 BBC version), Julia Sawalha as Lydia, Jasper Carrott\u2019s daughter Lucy Davis as Maria Lucas (she went on to star in The Office), Richard Briers\u2019 daughter Lucy as Mary, and Emilia Fox as Georgiana Darcy in her first TV role at the age of 19.", "\u2018One of my great pleasures is that most of the 19th-century novels have really young heroines so it\u2019s a chance to get people at an early stage of their careers and watch them develop after that,\u2019 says Andrew Davies.", "Today he has a soft spot for Julia\u2019s fun-loving, officer-mad Lydia but he wasn\u2019t sure the actress known for playing straight-laced Saffy in Ab Fab could pull it off. \u2018I said to Sue, \u201cIsn\u2019t she a bit low-key and sweet and demure for Lydia?\u201d And Sue said, \u201cYou haven\u2019t met her, have you?\u201d And Julia was absolutely brilliant.\u2019 In fact she was actually 25 playing 15. - Daily Mail", "Catastrophe occurred when Colin Firth had to shoot the underwater close-ups of him swimming in the lake in a large weed-filled tank at Ealing Studios some time after the outdoor scenes were filmed.", "\u2018The tank was covered by four heavy, metal-reinforced wooden slabs,\u2019 says director Simon Langton. \u2018On the day Colin was due to dive in, the plan was to remove all the slabs by crane. When I arrived the last slab was still in place but I was told there was no need to move it. Colin overheard this and intervened, saying nobly that he would take special care to avoid surfacing too late and hitting the slab.\u2019Against the director\u2019s better instincts filming commenced, but \u2018all too predictably the momentum of Colin\u2019s initial dive took him further than he\u2019d calculated, so he rose to the surface beneath the slab, hitting the metal support crossbar with a sickening thud \u2013 right on the bridge of his nose. I quietly died,\u2019 Simon admits with understatement.", "\u2018A series of scenarios flashed through my head \u2013 the producer Sue Birtwistle would give me the sack, shut down filming, recast Darcy and reshoot while Colin had his nose reconstructed.\u2019 In fact, by some miracle, the collision wasn\u2019t as bad as was feared. \u2018The swelling on Colin\u2019s nose wasn\u2019t conspicuous enough to merit rescheduling.

The discussion was about the UNHRC\u2019s resolution that recommended a \u201chybrid mechanism\u201d into the conflict and post-conflict situation in Sri Lanka. The Minister who was happy at the developments that have now taken place, emphasized that it was not the advise of any astrologer or the need to extend one\u2019s term of office, that made President Mahinda Rajapaksa to call for the January Presidential election. Instead, he was certain it was the prevailing fear in the government that come March 2015, the UNHRC Sessions in Geneva would certainly have framed charges against Mahinda Rajapaksa, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and many of the armed services personnel, engaged in the battle to defeat the LTTE. He had no word about any charges against the then Army Commander Gen. Sarath Fonseka, possibly because he thought Gen. Fonseka had been already punished by Mahinda Rajapaksa, in his quest for internal political revenge.", "What is strange is that none of this was the highlight of the UPFA\u2019s election campaign, where mainly spoke of the dangers to the Sinhala majority due to a rise of the LTTE, the danger of the \u201cTamil Diaspora\u201d, with Tamil separatism and terrorism, and the great development work done by the MR regime. We do know that MR, his key supporters Weerawansa and Gammanpila, and other catchers in the campaign did talk of the electric chair that awaited MR, but if the message that this minister said on TV was told to the public, with as much effect as he did, the result on January 8 may have been different.", "However, the minister is now most satisfied that with the new resolution at the UNHRC all those dangers are gone, and Sri Lanka is on the correct path to progress and reconciliation, with all the opportunities for development in the years ahead. One hopes such thinking will trickle to others in the UPFA, too.", "Yet, what is left of the \u201cUPFA Opposition\u201d \u2013 within quotes because the main part of the UPFA is in government -- has not given up its opposition to the Government\u2019s position of working in cooperation with the United Nations, and the revised Geneva resolution, where \u201chybrid\u201d is no more, and a fully domestic mechanism has been accepted. This section of the UPFA sees this as part of American and Western imperialism, targeting Sri Lanka, in the strategy for Western hegemony in the world. UPFA MPs Dinesh Gunawardena and Vasudeva Nanayakkara made this clear at a media briefing earlier this week. I refer to these two names only, because they have the seniority, and a strong leftist background, to know better about the current developments; and with due diligence and proper political analysis, be able to move away from hackneyed thinking about imperialism, when the country is moving forward in a era of new democracy. This does not rule out the machinations of capitalist and neo-liberal thinking and forces of the West, but it is certainly not sensible to look at every issue with such tinted glasses.", "What President Sirisena told the UN and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has been conveying to the people of this country, with much commitment, is the need for us to take a new turn in our journey to the future. This needs a clear acknowledgment of the past mistakes by all governments, the worst aspects of it being in the near decade of the Rajapaksa regime.", "What the Prime Minister has been emphasizing is the need to work in cooperation with the world as represented by the UN and its institutions, as well as, other organizations such as the Commonwealth, and go ahead with much effort and even difficulty, towards reconciliation and understanding. This is seen as the only way forward for a country lagging behind, despite very costly highways, displaying the extent of fraud and corruption that has prevailed, which needs rooting out through every means possible.", "The progress made in Geneva would mean, as the PM Ranil Wickremesinghe has shown, that we are moving into a new era of Commissions, which are necessary to guide the country in the search for the truth as to how our crises began and were allowed to grow until the county and people were smothered by a crisis that caused so much bloodshed from 1971 to 2005. In addition to knowing the truth, these are necessary for the process of reconciliation, which is so vital for proper island wide development of the sustainable type; development that is not directed by a family tree of political power, and racist or majoritarian thinking, but a wider holistic thinking of the entire nation.", "It is useful to recall that after the JVP insurrection in 1971, there was a commission appointed to study the needs of youth.

The idea of consensual government must be effective, by proceeding with no hesitation against the forces of corruption that have prevailed over the past decades.

I was nervously watching the sky. Would it freeze? Would it rain? I had spent two months settling into a new house in a new city. My girls had started a new school; my husband, a new job. My mother had just moved in upstairs. And now I was embarking on something I have never attempted before: starting a garden.\u201d", "It was First Lady Michelle Obama who said so, in her first ever book:\u2019 American Grown.\u2019", "All those who guessed the right answer may now proceed to quiz number two.", "Who said the following?", "\u2018I love to travel all over the country, spend at least six hours a day glued to my Mac writing away to earn a living and am always ready for an argument (provided it's about books) or an evening at the Punchi Theatre. Yet, since I started writing the \u201cDown to Earth\u201d series I realize I'd rather be digging around in my backyard than any other place on earth. Yet, during all these years I existed, the closest I came to gardening was over-watering the snake plant on my desk, which had an untimely death six months ago.\u2019", "If you can see the grin on my face right now, you would guess straight away who said the above. I did, of course.", "I confess my attempts at gardening are still too amateurish to boast about. But, what I learned even within this short span with a spade in my hands is enough to keep me hooked to digging, for the rest of my life.", "It came as no surprise that, after a spell of gardening of an evening, when I logged onto gardening sites on the net, I came across sites that said gardening could be a stress-buster.", "I didn't need psychiatrists, though, to tell me that the process of gardening is incredibly cathartic. I already knew, from experience.", "Even though, this may seem hard to believe (until you try it) every plant in your garden, will make you feel good. It is incredibly gratifying to watch a seed of bitter-gourd raise its tiny head from the ground, turn into a graceful vine and finally sprout beautiful four petaled yellow flowers. You might find the hours spent inspecting a Kathurumurunga plant for worms, too tedious, but scientists say, bending, stretching, reaching and stooping are invigorating. A good way to stop things from getting monotonous, according to expert gardeners, is to rotate your tasks from day to day. \u201cVariety is a must if you want to develop a garden work/pleasure ethos. One day it's weeding, the next it's removing branches and dead leaves, the next it's watering. I love visiting nurseries-buying new plants and bushes is better than buying new shoes,\u201d says Marian McEvoy, former editor of Elle D\u00e9cor and House Beautiful magazines.", "I know, you might find the transition from clothes and books and furniture to trees and flower beds not that easy. But the wonderful thing is whereas a skirt, or a settee, stays the same, a plant grows, changes shape and color, attracts bees and butterflies. They depend on you the way clothes and furniture do not. You have to water them, protect them from snails and beetles, pamper them with compost. Besides, clothes and furniture might fade, but they do not often wither and die. But, alas, death is a constant occurrence with plants, reminding you, every day, the philosophy of the sages:Nothing in this world is permanent, and we are foolish when we ask anything to last.", "Still, it's hard to watch an innocent plant in the throes of death. So, making a fist at death and chanting Donne's famous lines, \u201cDeath thou shalt die\u201d, I called the Horticultural Crop Research Development Institute, at Gannoruwa and asked them for advice. The answer I wanted to hear the most was what kind of vegetables will grow in my backyard, here in Colombo. The Programming Assistant who listened to me, very kindly explained brinjals, chillies, tomatoes and leafy vegetables like gotukola are the best plants for me. She assured me saying, \u201cGardening is not as complicated as you might think. All you need is a few square feet of the great outdoors, a water source, and a little time. Your grandparents did it, and so can you.\u201d In other words, the mantra goes like this: Find a good nursery and buy three or four plants of each kind. Dig the holes in a sunny place, within sight of the house. Wait. Watch. Repeat.", "The important word here, is \u2018repeat. For, gardening is a never-ending process. Massive rainfalls or extended droughts cause havoc. Weeding is a pain until you get into the rhythm of it. Snails, caterpillars and beetles have insatiable appetites. Some plants need pruning every week, some never flower, some flower but never bear fruits. And yet, when something actually takes hold, sprouts and grows tall and straight, it is worth all the mistakes and frustrations.", "Specially when the seeds you planted end up as food on your family's plates. I remember, Chef Pubilis, telling me sometime ago, it is essential that every household should have one tree of Karapinchha, one plant of green chilly and one bush of Rampe. In addition to all the other poison free, organic vegetables we could grow in our garden, that is. For, unarguably, fresh food is the best food! Ever wondered for how long the vegetables on your supermarket shelf have been there? For how long did they travel from Dambulla or Nuwara Eliya to your table? Comparing the flavor of a homegrown bundle of dambala with the taste of a store-bought one is like comparing Ceylon tea to any other tea in the world. If it tastes better, you will be more likely to eat the healthy, fresh produce that you know your body needs.", "And, when they are growing in your backyard, you won't be able to resist them. Moreover, their vitamin content will be at their highest levels as you bite into them straight from the garden. Parents, take note: A study published in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association found that preschool children who were almost always served homegrown produce were more than twice as likely to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day-and to like them more-than kids who rarely or never ate homegrown produce.", "So, keep digging: If I can do it, anyone can.", "\u2018We may have a wider approach to garden design if we have been helped to appreciate other forms of art: to be aware of basic principles - balance, repetition, harmony and simplicity - which apply to all forms of creativity'", "The Beth Chatto Gardens prove that a garden can be created in any conditions if the correct plants are used.", "When creating a garden you have to \u2018accept the existing conditions, choose the right plants for that location and work with what is there \u2013 plants must fend for themselves\u2019.", "According to Chatto, using what is there is the key, rather than taking the option that most gardeners do, of making wholesale changes to the soil and site to suit the traditional style.", "Everything in the garden is arranged so it looks good now and contributes in the future \u2013 one year, five years, ten years \u2013 so it is advantageous to know your plants.", "-Extracted from RHS Lessons from Great Gardeners : Forty Gardening Icons and What They Teach Us by Matthew Biggs (Octopus).", "\u00a0", "As indoor plants, orchids can look beautiful (although mind the petals as they are liable to drop off).", "* When you buy an orchid, it usually comes in a pot of loosely packed material, often chips of barks and small stones.

Some instances were reported in the media.", "While the focus was on the volatile east, the actions of the LTTE in the north did not receive the same glare of publicity. Lack of access to the LTTE dominated regions in the Northern mainland was the chief contributory factor to this state of affairs then. The unwillingness of many Tamil people to publicly articulate their grievances against the LTTE was another reason for the situation. The Tamil community grapevine was humming with tales of Tiger abductions but few Tamils were willing to come forward and say so openly.", "The main reason was fear of repercussions at the hands of the LTTE and its minions. Another reason was the feeling that the Tamil cause would be weakened if accusations were levelled against the LTTE. Family members of those conscripted were also afraid to speak out because the lives of those abducted may have been in jeopardy. Families were explicitly warned of such consequences if details of abductions leaked out.", "Besides many families concerned were also residing in LTTE controlled areas and themselves were in danger. The prevailing totalitarian control of society by the LTTE prevented people speaking out except for communicating their distress to trusted persons. All these reasons helped the LTTE to get away with continuous abductions and forced recruitment in those years.", "The scale and intensity of forced recruitment increased in 2006 as the fighting escalated. It was always the LTTE position that the movement faced a shortage of personnel because enough people were not volunteering. If enough numbers were forthcoming the elusive goal of Tamil Eelam would be a reality they used to say then. There was also much talk of a massive counter-strike against the armed forces by the LTTE. Additional cadres were necessary for this, it was argued by the LTTE then.", "While the military priorities and objectives were given pride of place the human dimension was once again lost sight of by the LTTE. The sad irony was that the war was being supposedly fought for the liberation and upliftment of the Tamil people! What was happening however was that of the position of the Tamil civilians worsening day-by-day.", "The LTTE may have wanted more and more people to join up and fight but the ordinary Tamils were in no mood to oblige. They simply wanted to be left alone to pick up the pieces of their fractured lives and get on with living. This war was not their war any more. The Tigers may have celebrated death but the ordinary Tamil people wanted life no matter how miserable it may have been under prevailing conditions. They did not want their children to die as cannon fodder in what was clearly an unwinnable war. Which parent would want that?", "The LTTE had earlier started the process of civilian arms training. All able bodied persons from 16 to 45 were required to undergo some physical training and learn techniques of self-defence. Those willing to go the extra-mile were given more intensive training and forged into an auxiliary outfit known as \u201cEllai Padai\u201d or border force. They functioned mainly as helpers to the LTTE cadres in border areas.", "Another category of persons was selected out of the original batches of trainees and given further training. They were supposedly reservists and called \u201cMakkal Padai\u201d or peoples\u2019 force. These people were allowed to get on with normal civilian life but were required to show up whenever necessary or required. Most members of these civilian militias were not willing to fight or die. But they had no choice and were reluctantly compelled to go along with Tiger diktat.", "These enlistment practices were overshadowed by a new direct campaign of forced recruitment that began in 2006. The intensification and acceleration of the LTTE campaign to forcibly recruit Tamil civilians directly into their ranks caused much resentment amid the Tamil people then. However they had no way to resist or protest. Some went into hiding. Others found ways to leave or escape from those areas. Those detected of trying to escape were punished. The LTTE also infiltrated the government controlled areas of Mannar, Vavuniya and even Jaffna districts and abducted people. However the full force of Tiger conscriptions was faced by the people of Kilinochchi and Mullaithivu districts.", "The LTTE which was running a parallel administration then set up its monitoring apparatus in the areas it controlled. There were two or more LTTE operatives functioning as \u201cgrama sevakhas\u201d in each village. They were in possession of all family details in every household in their areas of authority. LTTE operatives armed with such particulars visited each home and \u201cpress ganged\u201d the reluctant young men and women into joining them. If unsuccessful at day-time the Tigers returned at night. Nocturnal raids were a regular feature.", "All students in the Advanced Level classes were compelled to undergo training in self -defence and first-aid. The training period was between two to four weeks. The bright ones were identified and brainwashed or forcibly recruited as permanent cadres. Initially the families of fallen Tigers or \u201cgreat heroes\u201d and serving LTTE members were exempted. Later they too were targeted. Many of the parents stopped sending children to schools. Young people seldom moved around publicly. If they were seen the chances of being \u201ctaken\u201d away were very high. Some parents avoided going out to work and stayed home under the impression that they could prevent their children being taken.", "An incident in Kilinochchi illustrates the pathetic predicament of ordinary people then. A family of five in Aanandapuram in Kilinochchi was killed in bombing by the Air Force. Two of those killed were boys aged 18 and 20 respectively. The boys were kept at home to avoid being conscripted by the LTTE at school. Tragically \u201cYaman\u201d came for them at home via an Israeli K-fir. Students of that particular school were afraid to attend classes because the principal of that institution was allegedly helping the LTTE to identify and abduct students. The \u201cprincipal\u201d who was a close relative of a top Tiger commander is today holding high political office as an elected representative of the people.", "One way of avoiding conscription was to resort to matrimony since married persons were not forcibly recruited when the conscription campaign commenced. So many people in Tiger controlled areas began marrying early. With the recruitment drive being launched in June 2006 the rate of marriages shot up among young people. The LTTE then declared that all marriages after August 2006 were null and void. Regardless of marital status the new grooms and brides were conscripted. The LTTE also went to the extent of declaring a moratorium on marriages till a particular age was reached. Males could not marry till they were 40 and females till 35 was the new commandment. This was only a temporary measure assured the LTTE then.", "An incident of suicide that occurred then was pathetic. On January 22nd 2007 a school master from Uruthirapuram married an employee at the Mallavi hospital. Both were in their mid-twenties. Two days later on the 24th, LTTE operatives came to the newly married couple and insisted that the groom give up \u201cmarital bliss\u201d and join up with them. The \u201cwedding\u201d was not valid they pointed out because the \u201clegal\u201d marriage ages were 40 and 35. The distressed couple pleaded with the Tigers and obtained a few days \u201cgrace\u201d to complete wedding rituals. The Tigers agreed and went away.", "The groom and bride \u201cescaped\u201d and hid themselves elsewhere. The Tigers returned and were infuriated at this defiance. They abducted the groom\u2019s sister and the bride\u2019s brother and took them away. The groom was asked to present himself within a week. Otherwise the siblings would not return, warned the LTTE. The groom was extremely agitated and worried. After pondering the situation for days in a frustrated and confused mental state the man committed suicide by hanging on February 5th 2007. He died exactly two weeks after his marriage.", "This woeful tale was talked about widely in the LTTE areas and elsewhere. Many people were highly critical of the LTTE for this act which encapsuled the predicament faced by ordinary Tamils under the jackboots of the LTTE. In a bid to counter this resentment the LTTE put a counter spin by spreading the rumour that the man was diagnosed with terminal cancer and therefore had taken his own life.", "The LTTE also banned the movement of people to government controlled areas. People were allowed out only for specific reasons on a very strict basis. In most instances someone living in the Wanni had to stand surety. If the person who exited did not return on time the person who stood surety would be detained and punished. The LTTE was very strict in disallowing people between 12 and 17 from leaving the Wanni in those days.", "The people particularly the mothers resisted as much as they could. But most efforts were futile. Some of the stories related about those dark days are pathetic. One mother fell on the ground in front of a Tiger vehicle in a desperate attempt to block it from driving away with her son. The LTTE driver callously drove over the woman\u2019s leg crushing the bone. In another incident the frantic mother tried to cling on to her son but was pushed away roughly. She fell down and hit her forehead on a stone. Seeing the wife bleed the elderly husband/ father got angry and slapped the Tiger cadre. The Tigers were enraged. \u201cEngalukku Kai Neetta thuninjitiyo?\u201d (Are you brave enough to raise your hand against us?) they shouted. Thereafter the old man was given a merciless thrashing and was hospitalised.", "In one case the 21-year-old brother was given permission to go to Colombo to welcome an uncle who was visiting from abroad. His family guaranteed his return in three months. While he was in Colombo the LTTE recruitment drive escalated. Family members urged the son not to return but stay in Colombo and try to go abroad. When the LTTE went to the house the family said that the young man was sick and needed medical treatment in Colombo.", "The Tigers took away the 16-year-old sister and said she would be released if proof of the brothers medical condition was supplied. The brother got himself admitted to a private hospital and after some \u201cdoctoring\u201d with some sympathetic help by those concerned sent the the necessary \u201cpaperwork\u201d to convince the LTTE of his medical condition. The LTTE rejected the documents and wanted the family to give them medical records from a government hospital! The sister was under Tiger custody for many months and finally co-opted into LTTE ranks. She was killed in the fighting.", "The LTTE slogan for recruitment was \u201cVeetukku Oru Veeran Allathu Veeranganai\u201d (One hero or heroine from each house). The Tigers began strictly enforcing this. All households were forced to send one member. If those eligible escaped or avoided being recruited another was taken away as \u201chostage\u201d. Those protesting or objecting were assaulted severely. Some were detained for indefinite periods.", "Some of the persons taken by the Tigers managed to escape and went into hiding. The LTTE sent letters to the families saying the \u201cescapees\u201d must surrender themselves before a particular date. Otherwise family members would have to face consequences the Tigers warned. In another incident on February 9th 2007 in Vattakachchi an elder sister was taken in place of a younger sister who went into hiding. The protesting parents were kicked and pushed aside.", "An LTTE member had absconded from the Tigers after being sent to Vavuniya to do political work after the ceasefire. He came to Colombo and then went abroad. This was in 2003. After making inquiries from the family the LTTE did not do anything. But in 2006 the LTTE came to the house and wanted the \u201cescapee\u201d to return to the LTTE again. When told that he was now abroad the Tigers took away his younger sister aged 15. The family was told that the girl would be sent home if the brother returned to the country and the movement.", "Some people sent their children or even moved out of the LTTE controlled areas through circuitous jungle routes. There was much hardship and danger but people risked it rather than see children being conscripted. The LTTE\u2019s elite \u201cleopard\u201d commando unit also prowled these jungle routes keeping up vigil. While some people managed to escape many were caught and punished. One family had twin sons in their twenties. The LTTE wanted one to join up. The family tried to escape through a jungle route and was caught. As punishment both sons were taken away.", "One particularly sad incident was about a young girl in Puthukudiyiruppu. She was the only daughter in the family and very clever in studies. Her elder brothers had either died as LTTE \u201cMaaveerar\u201d or gone abroad. The family was however worried because the girl did not attain \u201cage\u201d for many years. Finally she became a \u201cperiya pillai \u201d(Loku Lamaiya) at the age of 18. The parents were so happy that they had a comparatively grand celebration on the \u201cday of pouring water\u201d. (thanni vaarkum naal). Two days later the Tigers came and took her away leaving the parents devastated.", "Some families from Allaipiddy and Mankumban had relocated to the Wanni after the spate of killings by the Navy and EPDP in May 2006. They felt the LTTE controlled Wanni was safer than their own villages. In 2007 some youngsters from these displaced families went missing. Family members rushed to the LTTE \u201cKaavalthurai\u201d (Police) run by Nadesan. The Eelam \u201ccops\u201d promised to inquire into the matter. It was only some days later that enlightenment dawned on the families that the \u201cfences had devoured the crops.\u201dAmong those taken away by the LTTE were some girl students staying with Catholic sisters at a nunnery and attending a Convent. The Tigers took those over 17 years of age forcibly. Church leaders appealed to the LTTE hierarchy but did not publicise the incident for obvious reasons.", "The LTTE also abducted young persons in the government controlled areas of Mannar, Vavuniya and even Jaffna. Age or marital status was not a bar when it came to abducting those in government controlled areas. They were taken to LTTE controlled areas clandestinely and forcibly inducted as Tiger cadres. It was alleged then that most incidents of youths abducted in Jaffna during daytime and then going missing were perpetrated by the LTTE. As the conflict intensified the use of mobile phones by members of the public was banned by the LTTE in the Wanni. Anyone found using one was penalised. All foreign calls could be taken only from LTTE run communication centres. The numbers had to be registered in the mornings. The calls limited to five minutes per call were allowed in the evenings. The time in between is used by the LTTE to verify details about those being called.", "There were however many who managed to come out of the Wanni in that period. This was mainly due to nepotism and/or corruption. High ranking Tiger leaders who had sent their own children abroad for higher studies were known to have intervened in some instances and ensured the \u201csending away\u201d of close relatives. In other cases massive donations were paid \u201cofficially\u201d to the LTTE and \u201cunofficially\u201d to Tiger officials for people to get away. The sad irony was that some of these escapees were treated as LTTE suspects when they came to the government controlled areas.", "This then was the grim, gloomy scenario that unfolded in the LTTE dominated north during the days of war. The so-called liberators of the Tamil people were intensely recruiting people forcibly to be conscripted into Tiger ranks. The rationale being manpower requirement was necessary to continue the \u201cPor\u201d (war). All oppression was justified as being necessitated by the Tamil cause.", "Ordinary Tamil civilians however wanted no part of this war being fought in their name. They only wanted to be left alone so that they could get along with their life. Sadly that was being denied to them. That was the Tamil tragedy! After some more years of terrible suffering the war was finally over in May 2009.", "dbsjeyaraj.com\u00a0"]},

The movie opens with the party bidding goodbye to Chand\u2019s single life back in India.", "Next it shows the blushing young bride getting ready to meet her husband and his family in Toronto. Metha sets the tone of the production from then on, projecting the discomfort and ill nature of Chand\u2019s spouse and his family.", "Our hunch is proven correct through Rocky\u2019s domineering mother. His father is good natured but too mild to control his children and wife\u2019s behaviour.", "Rocky\u2019s sister and her family too depend on Rocky to look after their needs. The eldest child is prone to playing pranks while the youngest is too little to be of any comfort to Chand. Her husband is cold and distant and seems to notice her only to vent out his anger.", "Desperate to contact her family in India and with no one to talk to Chand turns to her factory fellow worker, Jamaican born Rosa, for help. Her friend sees past Chand\u2019s attempts to hide her bruises and gives her a root saying that it a magic potion which will make whoever drinks it fall hopelessly in love with her.", "Though her first attempt backfires, Chand begins to have visions of a cobra in her backyard and with these hallucinations Rocky\u2019s role too seems to change from a tyrant to a protector.", "Mehta normally engages a lot of imagery in her movies. \u2018Heaven on Earth\u2019 is no exception. From the moment that it is indicated that the merriment is limited to the opening scenes and the images shift to a darker and gloomier atmosphere we realize that joy is short lived. The shift of the coloured scenes to black and white display the moment that Chand imagines what could have taken place had things been just as she hoped in her marriage. However unlike her previous works, the imagery in \u2018Heaven on Earth\u2019 seems overdone. Mehta follows her regular beat in questioning family values and cultural norms in Heaven on Earth as well. One such instance is when one character of the movie says that hell is better than a heaven without dignity. However unlike in movies like Fire, the universal quality of Heaven on Earth is evident for it centers on domestic violence away from an Asian set up, via a immigrant family living in a western country. No matter where they live, in most communities, women are meant to obey physical wrath with silence.", "Many other movie makers have dealt with the theme of domestic violence in their movies so it is inevitable that Heaven of Earth would be compared with them.", "Though it has often been weighted against Jag Mundhra\u2019s Provoked starring Aishwarya Rai and Naveen Andrews, one look at Heaven on Earth makes you realize that this is a story that stands on its own.", "The only common factor they possess is that both are very disturbing films on the plight of women who had to leave their native country and make a living with their husbands. \u2018Heaven on Earth\u2019 also deals with a mythical element via the cobra\u2019s tale.", "The star of the show is no doubt Preity Zinta who gives a stellar performance as the battered housewife, Chand. Vansh Bhardwaj too brings depth to Rocky\u2019s character. Both lead actors do well in bringing uniqueness to characters which could easily have fallen into stereotypes.", "For instance instead of playing the wounded victim, Zinta\u2019s character tries to understand and rehab her husband against all odds. Similarly Bhardwaj proves that Rocky is not entirely a villain. He does display his softer side in rare instances. This may not be Metha\u2019s best work but the movie is worth a watch for its cast\u2019s yeoman effort and its unique storyline.\u00a0"]},

In addition Jayawardene led the country to the Twenty20 finals too. But that they could not achieve the ultimate was not the cricketing god's wish.", "Both are now out of the game for the country. The writer makes bold to say that they did not over-stay their visas in the game, which is insensible thinking in certain quarters which want to avenge, alleging that the twosome scuttled the hurriedly arranged tour of England that crash landed. Both went out of the game when everyone was asking 'WHY' and 'WHY NOT'.", "England it is said gave the game of cricket to the world. They bossed over it and dominated it for long. But with other countries taking to the game in earnest, England's fortunes tumbled and they were struggling to keep their greatness in the game alive. Now with their fortunes dwindling, comes the news that England have signed on Jayawardene as their Batting Consultant. Now all Sri Lanka must be proud of Jayawardene's achievement. Jayawardene was a rare straight playing batsman that the Sri Lankan game has produced.", "Whoever thought that England would need a Sri Lankan to show them how to bat correctly. But that is how the game goes --and that shows the renown with which Jayawardene is held. He will surely show them how to play straight to achieve success.", "Jayawardena was one of the technically sound batsmen in world cricket. Batsmen who wield a straight bat don't come dime a dozen. In the past Sri Lanka had many technically sound batsmen who were treats to watch and rare examples. To name a few there was Michael Tissera, Anura Tennekoon, Roy Dias, Sidath Wettimuny, and Marvan Atapattu.", "But sadly now with the 'hit out, or get out' game of limited over cricket given precedence over the established game - Test cricket - technically correct batsmen don't come that easy like beautiful damsels.", "England seem to be raving over the signing of Jayawardene as Batting Consultant. The man who seems over the moon for this bit of good thinking by England is Ian Bell. Bell it must be stated was England's most technically correct batsman playing a straight bat. But of late his batting has been flawed and has been in a run drought.", "Jayawardena's first fling with the England team will be in the United Arab Emirates where England is slated to play Pakistan in a Test series.

To have his input leading into the series and all the preparations, is going to be huge for us. I am really looking forward to that.", "'He was certainly hard to get out in those conditions, so I'll be picking his brain all the way through if I can, probably badgering him a bit too much, but trying to get everything I can out of him to make my game better'. Great pride and honour for Sri Lanka, England's signing of Jayawardena as Batting Consultant.", "While England are raving over the signing of Jayawardene, Sangakkara went great guns with English County Surrey, scoring tons of runs and taking the club's cricket to a new high.", "With his retirement from the hard grind of Test cricket for the country, which is mental torment and physically taxing, the leftie seemed to be much relaxed as his approach to batting was showing and runs and centuries for Surrey came naturally.", "He justified the confidence Surrey placed in signing him on and after a long time Surrey entered a 50-over final riding on the back of magnificently carved out 160 in the semi-final against Nottingamshire which attack included Stuart Broad who tormented Australia during the Ashes series. He made 60 in the final against Warwickshire and that they could not win the final, losing by a few runs was a travesty of justice.", "Jayawardene and Sangakkara who are supremely fit cricketers have shown that they could have played and served the country for at least another couple of years if they wished. But being the caring players they went out early. Jayawardene and Sangakkara are still continuing with Jayawardene playing in Windies bash and now being signed on by Central Districts to play in Kiwiland.", "'Two proud nations', 'Two super powers'. That is how 'STAR SPORTS' is forcefully advertising the South Africa Test series against India on TV due to begin shortly in India.", "But what is heartening, welcome and an example is that the series has been labeled the Nelson Mandela - Mathama Gandhi series, with the Cricket Boards of both proud nations breaking away from the stereo type of playing Test series in honour or memory of past cricketing greats.", "Australia and India play for the 'Border-Gavaskar Trophy'. Sri Lanka and Australia play for the 'Warne-Muralitharan Trophy'. Australia and West Indies play for the 'Benaud- Worrell Trophy'. England and Australia play for 'The ASHES URN'. And now West Indies and Sri Lanka will play for the Sobers-Tissera Trophy.", "Great that the heroes of democracy are being remembered. Gandhi helped India gain Independence from colonial rule without shedding a drop of blood. He is the father of India with Ahimsa as his hallmark. Gandhi is best remembered for his ideals of truth and non-violence and his philosophy of Satyagraha", "Mandela (AKA) 'Black Pimpernel', suffered long in a jail for fighting to deliver his black people from the cruel, inhuman and dreaded Apartheid. That he finally succeeded in bringing the whites on their knees was great triumph and an example to the world. I can only guess that both these world leaders had sports in their DNA for all that they did was underpinned by the ideals of sportsmanship", "Congratulations then to the Board of Control for Cricket in India and the South African Cricket Board for remembering these two freedom fighters and great statesman who were examples to world leaders. The world of today needs more Gandhis and Mandelas. India and South Africa are fielding two of the most formidable teams in world cricket and as such an electrifying series is on the cards for cricket fans. That spectators will flock all venues to watch these champions at play there will be no doubt. We hope there will be no bottle throwing incidents.", "By the way enjoy life now.

The firm, which declared \u00a31.1 billion in global turnover last year and is rapidly expanding in the United States, has avoided UK corporation tax for years by moving revenues out of the country through a complex offshore network. Some of that money ends up in Hastings Trading e Servi\u00e7os Lda \u2013 the Madeira company that acquired 95% of Sky Network, with the president\u2019s nephew retaining the other 5%.", "BuzzFeed News interviewed two former executives at Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) who said the majority state-owned firm was all but forced to pour millions of dollars into Sky Network and got nothing in return. A senior detective in the Sri Lankan police force said it had \u201cstarted the legal process of investigation\u201d into the deal, and the country\u2019s deputy foreign minister confirmed that the new probe was part of the wider international hunt for assets allegedly stolen during Rajapaksa\u2019s decade of Presidency.", "Searching for Sri Lanka\u2019s embezzled billions is a daunting task for the new regime, which came to power when former President Rajapaksa was finally ousted by voters in January this year, especially because it presides over a country still emerging from decades of civil war. Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne told BuzzFeed News that investigators believe the political family under question had gone to extraordinary lengths to hide stolen assets from the state.\u00a0", "In total, the new government estimates that the bigwigs and associates of the previous regime have hidden at least $10 billion through a web of offshore accounts, various associates, and business ventures around the world. They believe $5.31 billion was taken out of Sri Lanka in 2013 alone. And they are determined to find the money and bring it home.\u00a0"]},

Only a few European countries score 100 or over. They are Switzerland, Austria, Netherlands, Norway, Luxembourg, Italy, and Iceland.", "There is general agreement today that average IQ scores of countries are indicative of access to high quality education rather than innate intelligence of people.", "Thus research evidence shows a very high correlation between level of educational attainment and scores in intelligence tests. In this regard, scores in maths, science and language are closely related to scores in IQ tests. So, a lower average IQ score is indicative of the quality of the country's education system, educational inequalities and access to quality education.", "A study conducted by the national education research and evaluation centre (NEREC) of the University of Colombo in 2004 on educational performance of primary school students in the country showed that performance of a large proportion of primary schoolchildren in the country in such areas as maths, science and language was poor and this no doubt was indicative of the serious deficiencies of the education system of the country.", "There has been so much criticism of our education system over the last several decades. While one of these has been our almost total preoccupation with memory testing examinations from Grade 5 right up to university level at the expense of providing children and youth with a more skill oriented, all round education that emphasized critical thinking, problem solving skills and life skills, logical reasoning, etc., the other has been on the growing educational inequalities within the country, leading to unnecessary concentration of a large proportion of children in a few privileged schools, both public and private and deprivation of many who attend poorer rural and urban schools.", "As is well known, the vast majority of secondary schools do not have facilities to teach subjects in the science stream at GCE AL. Moreover, many underprivileged schools do not have competent maths and science teachers. What should also be noted is that the quality of teachers has declined over time, forcing most parents to take children around to give them private tuition to make up for the deficit of school instruction.", "Today most children spend many hours travelling back and forth from schools rather than concentrate on reading and other education or real life related activities.", "In spite of the presence of serious issues within the country's education system, successive governments and national educational institutions have shown little or no interest in responding to these in a rational and systematic manner.", "Meanwhile, we talk about the need to allocate more money for education, as if this is the most important problem in education, whereas the biggest challenge seems to be to liberate education from persisting political control.", "As is well known, every newly appointed minister begins to pretend that he or she knows everything and educationists, if at all have to play second fiddle to him or her. This is a recipe for disaster because all those who know something about education take a back seat and enjoy life, without making an effort to point out that most education ministers, perhaps with the exception of the first Education Minister, Dr. C.

But the vast majority of people and the country suffer because a majority of children and young people leave schools and the universities with a poor quality education, often with almost no skills and capabilities. Many of them join the informal sector or the largely unproductive state sector or leave the country for unskilled employment in the Middle East, Italy or South Korea.", "Unless and until the educational deficiencies mentioned earlier are effectively remedied, the country will continue to rank low in world league tables on educational attainment which is reflected in the poor average IQ score of the country.", "The countries that do well in this regard in Asia and elsewhere will naturally lead in innovation and skill driven development, leaving countries like ours far behind. This is not to suggest that development depends entirely on general intelligence which largely depends on educational attainment.", "There are naturally many other factors which cannot be discussed here for want of space. But the fact of the matter is that a country like Sri Lanka which does no longer have its cheap labour advantage or massive natural resources like gold or oil deposits, has to concentrate on human resource development as a way out of the present economic predicament. It is important to bear in mind that the countries that are higher on average IQ of populations are among the most competitive in the global economy. Among these are many European countries like Switzerland as well as Asian countries like Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea.", "What we need to learn from these countries is that the spread of general education alone is not sufficient to equip the younger generations with the skills, the world views and the capabilities necessary to fit into a complex and competitive world.", "There is enough evidence to show that we, like many other countries in the developing world, are not up to this challenge. Many people in this country are steeped in myths, superstition and uncritical religiosity which are usually antithetical to logical reasoning and critical thinking.", "Education in Sri Lanka today by and large prepares children for memory testing examinations at the expense of the knowledge of the link between what they learn from textbooks and the world out there.

There is no sub-plot. Shakespeare has constructed it with great structural economy even without introducing the main characters. Shakespeare wrote Macbeth during the last quarter of his writing career.", "He probably wrote it in 1606 and it comes amid other tragedies including King Lear, and Anthony and Cleopatra after Hamlet and Othello and before Coriolanus, the last of his tragedies before he moves to the romantics (Smith, 2013).", "The year 1606 was a turbulent one in early modern England with James VI of Scotland succeeded Elizabeth I on the English throne. Shakespeare became the chief dramatist of the king. Shakespeare turned his attention on royal interests. Macbeth in one sense is a regicide play like Richard II (1595) and Julius Caesar (1599) though the contexts are different.", "Macbeth also contains a story of deposition like in As You Like It, The Tempest and Hamlet. Shakespeare analyses the mind of a political assassin in Macbeth. In Hamlet, he scrutinises Hamlet's revenging ego. But in Macbeth Shakespeare deals squarely with Macbeth's burning ambition.", "The greatest weakness of Macbeth was that he failed to understand the metaphorical language used by The Witches. This caused his downfall. He completely misjudged their prophecies. What their poetic language articulated and connoted, Macbeth misunderstood whereas Lady Macbeth seriously pondered.", "Act 1 Scene 1 presents the three Witches in an open place in a thunder storm on the moorland before sunset. It is in Scene 3 that the witches encounter Macbeth and Banquo who were on their way home after their war victory.", "While reading the text the readers are often attracted to the poetic language used by The Witches:", "\u201cWhen shall we three meet again?", "\nIn thunder, lightening or in rain?", "\nWhen the huryburys done,", "\nWhen the battle's lost and won.\u201d (1.1.3-4)", "These syllabic, short lines in blank verse are iconic, rhythmic and packed with imagery and mystic power. The opening scene of Macbeth produces rich audio visual effects upon the audience when the witches mention about the clap of thunder, the flash of lightning and the pitter-patter of pouring rain; thus creating a stormy future atmosphere.", "These Wearied Sisters (The Witches) greet Macbeth thus:", "\u201cAll hail Macbeth! Hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!", "\nAll hail Macbeth! Hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!", "\nAll hail Macbeth! That shall be king hereafter.\u201d (1.3.48-50)", "In this verse there is repetition of same words (anaphora) used as a rhetorical term in the beginning of the lines.", "Macbeth very well knew that he was already Thene of Glamis through inheritance caused by Sinal's death. But how could The Witches know it? His greatest astonishment was the other two prophecies of The Witches, in particular the predication of him becoming the future king. About becoming Thane of Cawdor, Macbeth was aware of the execution of Cawdor through the king's message.", "But Macbeth becoming the future king too has been professed by The Witches. This prophesy too should be correct. But there is already King Duncan on the throne and Macbeth is not the legal, royal, traditional heir. This fact vexed Macbeth tremendously. Initially he left this third prophecy to be fulfilled perhaps by chance. Macbeth was perturbed, surprised and frightening over the last prediction. But he was afraid of Banquo who was with him when The Witches stated these prophesies. No doubt an Oedipus effect began to torment Macbeth's train of thoughts at the end of the first meeting with The Witches. This effect was nursed, encouraged and ignited by Lady Macbeth's strategic interventions by persuading Macbeth to commit murder. Again the power of The Witches is revealed in Act 1V Scene 1. When Macbeth arrives to consult them, The Witches were preparing a foul broth and arranging their spell. They create three apparitions in order an armed head who warns Macbeth against Macduff; a bloody child who informs him that he cannot be harmed by one \u2018borne of woman\u2019, and a crowned child carrying a tree who guarantees Macbeth's safety until Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane Hill.", "As a response to Macbeth's question about Banquio's descendants, The Witches show him eight Kings ushered in by the spirit of Banquo. The Witches vanish when Lennox brings the news of Macduff's flight to England. Macbeth decides to murder every member of Macduff's family.", "The Witches do not make promises. They utter riddles. Macbeth in his weakness interprets in his own ambitious interest. He is not deceived by the Witches, but by his ill-founded reliance on his own interpretation (Macrae, 1980). Shakespeare reveals that Macbeth until the end has been clinging to the prophesies of The Witches. The prophesies have been correct. But Macbeth has been misled.", "References:", "Macrae Alasdiar D.F (1980) Macbeth, Longman York Press, Essex, England", "\nSmith Emma (2013) Macbeth-Language & Writing, Bloomsbury, London\u00a0"]},

They are denoted as those who come from distant places to the more suburban colleges in order to achieve a higher and better state of education.", "In this climate either they have to stay in the college hostel or in the houses of their nearer and dearer relatives. But it is found that the selection on the part of parents to lodge their children in college hostels is a result of the advent of a new colonial education as versus the age old phenomenon of going to school from one's own house which is known in the traditional system of education as 'gederin gurugedarata' (from the house to the house of the guru or the teacher).", "The patterns of education change and as a result the children who so attend the schools from their parental residences are perhaps forced to stay in the school hostels as an alternative measure.", "This may look a global phenomenon. Quite a number of books have sprung up in this set up of staying in school or college hostels. With the passage of time some of the books have turned into films of lasting interest. One such book made into a film is 'Goodbye Mister Chips' written by James Hilton. Then comes another work titled as Blackboard Jungle, the creator of the work sadly I don't remember now.", "Whether written in the form of a novel or in any other form, the recollection of hostel events as jotted down in nostalgic manner may be of interest either as fascinating historic events of the past or as personal reminiscences transformed in order to recreate the memorable past as a series of memoirs.", "Such a work came to me during the Book Fair season. The title of the book goes as Ananda Bodime Sangawunu Rasakatha (The hidden fascinating stories from the Ananda College hostel) authored by Devsiri P Hevavidana [Dayawansa Jayakody publication] of Galle. Running to thirty chapters, the writer Hevavidana who lives in England at the moment, and an engineer by profession, had found time to devote on this recollection of writing notes from time to time to periodicals in his birthplace Sri Lanka. He attempts to trace a wide gamut of events and experiences from the moment of how he entered Ananda hailing from Galle where he had the primary formal education.", "He writes in the form of mini narratives all about his parental heritage and the influence on him with great gratitude and honour. Then he enters the realm of teachers and friends who happened to be his close companions all throughout.", "They are brought to the forefront like in a series of dramatic episodes tinged in a sense of humour enabling the reader for a non stoppable premise. Most of the material had been published as newspaper columns perhaps making his expression clearer.", "It is an age old method employed by most contributors to journals and newspapers to collect and preserve thus the features thus printed into a single publication which eventually goes to prove that the materialthus printed had not gone a waste and/or lost to the posterity. Devsiri Hevavidana remembers various names of his companions and the places from which they had come to be hostellers. He also remembers the various types of advantages of being a hosteller over and above.", "Then he remembers the strictness as well as the lenience on the part of the teachers supplemented with examples. Some of the present day social stalwarts like politicians, administrators and business magnates as well as diplomats have been his fellow hostellers. They have been instrumental in bringing back smiles as well as tears on account of the gone by episodes. But the writer makes it a point that he writes in a positive manner allowing the past to live in the present. He sees at times the 'practical joke' concept utilised as part and parcel of youth hood perhaps as a pardonable factor.", "One such example is the incident about the good old teacher who had the habit of driving his Bug Fiat to school and used to park in a place where anybody could see.", "The teacher is portrayed as one who was so fond of his car that he kept it spick and span. But one hosteller who was a bright and intelligent fellow also had a queer character about him which forced him to push the car to a remote corner in the college premises. On finding that the car had disappeared, the owner had to inevitably undergo a mental pain beyond reason before the eyes of the others who rallied round him. He had been crying that his car is lost.", "The hostellers had to go in search, with perhaps to all the visible areas in the college premises. Then they discovered that the car had been pushed by someone or a group to a muddy rut.", "This becomes not only a surprise but also a punishable offence and a mystery. Who could be the culprit behind the scene? And who to be punished, and how to detect the culprit to punish was a burning. This goes as a trick ending narrative where all the hostellers had been warned of the punishment issue. The innocent hostellers too may be the victims. Thus the scene develops and several suspects in the rush were taken to task.", "Who pushed the teacher's Bug Fiat to this muddy rut happened to be the question. What happened in the end is the most interesting point. One hosteller came to the rescue of the others with a confession which is recorded as a mischief done with fun -all alone without much thinking about the consequences. Perhaps I presume that the reader is compelled to know a wee bit of psychology in order to understand this event.", "There are moments in the life of hostellers who have seen phantoms and apparitions in the night/ The subject is taken seriously in order to create fun and thrill.", "The advantages of being in company than in isolation are underlined in most pages. The challenges as well as skills encountered by young men of a particular period in their lives are recorded vividly bringing back to one's mind how down to earth events could have moulded and socialized in order to make a person fit into the future world.", "Hevavidana envelopes quite a number of photographs that brighten the experiences in the pages.\u00a0"]},

Actually, there are a few courses which you can follow even if you have basically failed these examinations and the certificates issued by the course providers are generally recognized by the industry. In this respect, it is important not to despair if you have not done well at one examination or both examinations.", "But before you do anything else, it is important to brush up on your knowledge of the Queen's Language which is essential for every subsequent step of your life, including a career move. There are plenty of courses and books which can point you in the right direction, but nothing beats speaking in English with your parents, teachers, friends and relatives. Do remember that formal English tests are required by some higher educational institutions and employers, so a grammatical and spelling knowledge too will not go waste. Moreover, do improve on your vernacular (Sinhala and/or Tamil) language knowledge as well because most employers look for excellent interpersonal skills. I will focus on foreign education in another column, so this column will essentially focus on the steps you can take before mulling a local course, some of which can help you to get a job abroad.", "Having gained a working knowledge of English, you can next look for a suitable course. The English knowledge you acquired comes in handy here as well, because most courses are now taught in English. The course that you will select generally depends on what kind of person you are.", "Are you a hands-on person ? Or would you rather work in an office ? Perhaps you like to travel around ? Or do you have a knack for a particular subject ? All these aspects must be considered before you sign on the dotted line for a course, which might cost a fair amount of money that will most probably be provided by your parents. So it pays to be wise here before shelling out cash.", "There are many courses to select from in today's education scene. You will get a fair idea of the range available if you go to an education or job fair.", "These are held fairly regularly, so you will be able to attend one near your place of residence. It is also advisable to go through the Education Pages of Sunday English newspapers, which will also give you a very good idea of the courses available locally, sometimes with foreign tie-ups.", "First, select a few options before deciding on one course or stream straightaway. To cite an example, you may select accountancy, law and motor mechanism. Then you can do some research on the shortlisted courses and vocations. First, talk to your friends and relatives who have done these courses and perhaps even found good jobs by now.", "They will be able to brief you on the pros and cons of each course - there is always no guarantee that you will get a job at the end of the day, but you can probably find one if you persevere. Ask them about the different stages that have to be completed, since it may not be necessary \"to go the whole hog\" to get a job. Remember that some employers allow and even encourage you to follow the rest of the course, once you are in. This way, you can learn while you earn and hopefully gain a promotion too.", "The other great resource for research is, of course, the Internet. You should first study the websites of the relevant institutions, which are usually very reliable sources of information on everything from the duration to the costs (including exam fees) of their various courses. You will also be able to download course modules, past papers and study aids so that you can gain a knowledge what is in store if and when you finally join the course. Do look for student forums where the students discuss their concerns, problems and frustrations on various courses.", "This will give you an idea of what kind of problems to expect as you go along. Finally, do check whether any institution offers remote learning via the Web, which means you can be more flexible with time. This way, you might even be able to learn two course streams at once.", "Whatever you do, recognition is very important - if your certificate or qualification is not recognized worldwide, it may not be worth your time and money, especially if you are thinking of foreign employment or migration one day. After thoroughly researching all these aspects, you will most probably be ready to choose the next move of your life.\u00a0"]},

This month, October 30th marks the 25th anniversary of their forcible expulsion from the North by the LTTE. Since then, many of the Muslims have put down roots in other parts of the country, mainly in Puttalam and to a lesser extent other areas such as Anuradhapura, Galle, and Colombo. As is their right however, at war's end in 2009, those who were unable to feel settled in their newly settled areas have chosen to return to their homelands - a process that has not been facilitated for them by either the government or Tamil community, despite the irreparable wrong done to them 25 years ago.", "The returnees have many experiences to report on the hardships of resettling in their homeland but supreme love for their motherland they say, overrides all other considerations, to make them persevere.", "Of these, the Jaffna Muslims are the worst hit among all the Northern Province Muslims, in terms of receiving little to no repatriation help. Being a minor political constituency, they have neither Muslim nor Tamil politicians campaigning to address their issues. It's nearly six years now since many of them have resettled in Jaffna after war's end.

And this excruciatingly slow process of Jaffna's Muslim quarters gradually regaining its neighbourhood tone has little to do with government facilitation.", "The recurring refrain one hears from the community, is their disappointment at the Government and Tamil politicians, for not reaching out to help.", "\"In other districts, there are Muslim MPs to see to Muslim constituencies, but in Jaffna we don't have such a representative. The Tamil politicians play the communal card and do nothing to address our needs though from time to time they pay lip service to it,\" lament the Muslims resettled in Jaffna.", "They are very careful however not to conflate Tamil politicians with the Tamil people.

They had been told that they could take Rs.500 with them but in some cases were stripped of even that, after which they were transported like cattle by the LTTE in trucks, to be dumped just outside Jaffna - and from there, told to walk all the way to Puttalam.", "\"They told us to stamp the dust off our feet as we left, that we could not take even that from their Eelam which belonged only to Tamils. They were that cruel,\" reported one returned Muslim lady. The shock of that extreme and unwarranted cruelty displayed by the LTTE is still fresh in the minds of the Muslims.", "They had always perceived themselves as having cordial relations with the Tamils and so the sudden ethnic cleansing that was visited upon them took them completely by surprise. They still have no answer as to why this happened other than that the LTTE perhaps wanted to harvest their wealth.", "\"Due to our religious beliefs, we did not save our money in banks, we saved them instead in gold biscuits.", "In one morning, they piled all our jewellery, cash and gold biscuits in front of us and gloated that they had gained the wealth of a mini Saudi Arabia,\" explained one former businessman who had three vehicles at his disposal in 1990, now reduced to driving a hired three-wheeler for a living.", "25 years from the expulsion and six years since resettlement, disappointingly little has been done in terms of outreach and reparation by the Tamil community towards the Muslim community.", "While many of the Muslims refuse to call out the Tamils for this, at least one elderly man voiced his hurt on this issue as well.", "\"I am 68 years old now, I fear I will die without the issue of what happened to us in 1990 ever being addressed - and with my generation will die the pain and knowledge of all that transpired.", "There will be no learning or restitution from it.

Some of these Tamil nationalists repeatedly make an outcry about all the wrongs done to them by the Government but if we try to raise the issue of what happened to us, they say we are repeating the same tired old refrain again and again. Why these double standards?\"", "We didn't really have an answer to give him. We thus put the question to our Tamil readers. Can you answer? Why is there this double standard by the Tamil community towards the Muslim community, in the North? Why do we seek reparations for the wrongs done to us as a community whilst endeavouring at the same time to brush under the carpet, the wrongs done to the Muslims as a community, by our community? Why do we hold the central government and Sinhalese politicians to task for not addressing Tamil issues adequately but not hold the Tamil provincial politicians to task for not addressing Muslim issues adequately?", "Why have we left our Muslim brethren alone to fight lonely fights, often losing fights, for their rights? When they were evicted from Jaffna, many of the Muslims here were some of the wealthiest people in the land. Stripped of all their money and property before they left, they have returned to live in hovels in most cases.", "Yet of the thousands of houses granted to war-affected people in Jaffna by the Indian Government, only 45 houses have been allocated to the Muslim community.", "\"The Tamil Government Officials in Jaffna are openly prejudiced against us. They make us run from pillar to post for every little thing, deliberately exhausting us in the process. In the case of this housing scheme, they initially allocated only 25 houses for our community. We had to campaign long and hard before they made it at least 45 houses. We were fed up with the amount of protests we had to carry out before achieving even this small concession. Now the scheme is over. They afforded us a few houses only in its last stages,\" says an activist in the J88 area of Jaffna, where many Muslims are resettled.", "The government officials for their part give various excuses, such as the Muslims already having been given housing in Puttalam (though only a few of them actually were), and that many of the Muslims don't live permanently in Jaffna and are instead a floating population between Puttalam and Jaffna. There are various sociological and economic reasons for this floating pattern of existence which the Muslims have been reduced to, that are not being addressed as they should, and has instead become a convenient stick to beat them with. If there are not enough facilities in Jaffna to live permanently, and there are many family members left behind in Puttalam who have chosen to remain there, why would not the Jaffna Muslims be a floating population? What the Muslims are employing for their social and economic survival is being negated as duplicity by the Jaffna officials who say that they do not deserve allocations and benefits from Jaffna if they are going to be residents of Puttalam. This conveniently does not address the fact that not enough has been done in Jaffna to enable families to feasibly settle permanently here.", "Yet, despite all these odds there are about 3000 families permanently settled in Jaffna now, who have not received much benefit due to it. \"A high ranking Tamil government official, in a bid to prove that we were not actually living in Jaffna as we said we were, came on a personal visit to check our houses. All those dwellings that were locked when she visited in the middle of the day were marked as unoccupied. The implication was that these residents had lied when they said they were living in Jaffna. This was one of the ways they reduced our numbers eligible for the Indian Housing Scheme. Did she not think that at that time, the man of the house would be out working, the children would be at school and the lady of the house marketing or on some other errand? This same process was not carried out for Tamil households. How do they get to arbitrarily decide to treat us so differently?\" ask the Muslim community.", "Their families have lived in this area of town for generations, but they remember that even this was not where their ancestors originally settled. 1990 was by no means the first time expulsion had been forced on the Muslim community of Jaffna.", "\"Our ancestors used to live in Nallur and Musali from which they were driven out in 1838. That is when they came and settled in this area, which has now become part of Jaffna town,\" explained one of the community elders.", "Living in the middle of town as they are, without adequate urban planning or facilities, they grapple with many frustrating problems that are not being addressed effectively either.", "\"It took years to get electricity and running water to this area though it is in the heart of Jaffna town,\" says one lady asked specifically on the issues women and children face while resettling, within the community. \"There are not many job opportunities for women here. Wealthier members of the community who have repaired their houses have rented them out to us but this being a town area, we can't earn through rearing poultry or livestock. Meanwhile, in nearby abandoned properties that have been left to grow wild with shrubbery, snakes and mosquitoes are breeding and we fear for our children's safety.\"", "The men of the community engage in small-time business or drive three wheelers to support their families. A few are government officials. \"Most of our men have taken loans to buy motorcycles or three-wheelers to facilitate their businesses.", "Now they are gone from early morning till late at night, trying to earn back enough money to pay off those loans. Many of our children are thus growing up without knowing their fathers.", "The fathers are gone by the time they wake up and return only after they have fallen asleep, such is our lot,\" laments another woman.", "Having come through all these hardships, some in the community are determined to stick it out but others are considering returning to the areas they had relocated to post their expulsion in 1990.", "\"We never felt at home in any of those places. We always remembered Jaffna as our homeland with so much nostalgia and returned after the war ended with so much hope. Now however, we are being slowly driven out. We have been made to feel as if we don't belong here either.\"", "This is a sad reflection of what the Muslim people feel, along with what the Tamil people have made them to feel. 25 years since their expulsion, after all that our two communities have been separately through, have we the Tamils, nothing to offer in terms of solidarity to the Muslims?"]},

This has been the base for the continuing close relationships between Sri Lanka and Japan, with that Land of the Rising Sun being for many years the largest donor and provider of foreign aid and investment in this country. Much of this has been mentioned in the media this week, and needs no repetition.", "The highlight of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe's call to Japan was to seek support and cooperation towards Sri Lanka's efforts to create national reconciliation and peace. He said that Sri Lanka solicited the support of the Japanese government towards summoning an international aid conference to assist Sri Lanka to rebuild the social and economic status of areas damaged by war, and also help take Sri Lanka go forward into a new era of economic progress, where science and technology has a major role to play.", "This shows a recognition by the Prime Minister of the vital role that speedy and relevant economic development, in keeping with properly planned guidelines, can and must play in proceeding with the tasks of peace and reconciliation. The voices of the pro-MR groups in and out of Parliament ,against what they insist on calling the \"hybrid\" mechanism and the developments in Geneva, have every opportunity to play into falsely generated fears among the people, if the pace of economic progress in slowed. This is a reality one has to face, in the context of the global economic decline, the turn-down in the economy of China, the revision downward of global economic growth by the IMF, and the problems faced by Europe both in its economy an its unity.", "Just as the agreement signed with Japan to develop the BIA, and discussions towards Japanese investment in digitalizing our communications sector, there are several areas where Japanese investment in infrastructure could help in the rapid real progress of this country. One hopes that the mono-rail proposal made by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, when he visited Sri Lanka last year, and which was not taken up by the MR regime, possibly looking to China on this too. One hopes such offers would be looked at again, to develop our transport system, beyond the highway obsession that is high on environmental harm and cost.", "Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe's visit to Japan is certainly a pathfinder mission, in the new situation that Sri Lanka is placed in. It hopefully shows an understanding of the political realities of economic progress, that remains a necessity to deliver on the promises, to the country and the world, on peace, reconciliation, accountability and human rights. His leadership in this area is shown in the call for Japanese help towards summoning an international aid conference to assist Sri Lanka to rebuild the social and economic status. This will need a good diplomatic effort in the coming weeks and months, and also should be kept in focus in all public debates on progress, leaving little room for so-called \"nationalists\" who are in fact racist extremists to build on their falsehoods about the Geneva resolution.", "I return here to what I have said in my first paragraph, glad that the UNP did not go on a crazy cutout welcome binge to greet the Prime Minister on his return, which, if done, would only give some strength to the MR group in the Opposition, and some of them in the Cabinet, too. The least one needs is to bring down the best impressions of his most relevant, timely, and valuable visit to Japan and the discussions held there. Here's hoping for the new strengthening of Japan- Sri Lanka relations, at a time of many rivalries and controversies in areas such as the South China Sea, the South East Asian Region, and most importantly, the Indian Ocean Region.", "I refer here to the most pertinent editorial in today's \"Daily News \"(Thursday, 08/10/15) \"Rajapaksa, and his new take on the police\". As it correctly described, he has given up the temple circuit and taken to issuing media statements on selected topics; among which is the failure of the police to nab the big or right persons involved in criminal activity. He faults the police for only netting in the sprats and letting the sharks get away; as he says it: \"the police only brought to book, petty thieves, but those engaged in large scale robberies, extortion, murder, rape, drugs, ethanol etc. escaped from the long arm of the law.\"", "It would seem a farce for the immediately preceding Head of State to make such a statement, because there is little to show that the police were any better than they are today, when he was not only President and Head of State, but also the Cabinet Minister in charge of the police, too, as Minister of Defence. Very late in his term, when Geneva problems were impacting on the country, the police was handed to a new Ministry of Law and Order, also held by him, but with a different Secretary, whereas for the entire early period the Secretary was his own brother Gotabaya Rajapaksa.", "The brutal rape and murder of little Seya Sandewmi, and the apparent mess the police has got into on this investigation, is what has given the opportunity to MR to shed such public tears about a crime and also find fault with the police.", "The problem as I see it is that such tear shedding has now become a family business of a new nature. It is not only the father who talks of police incompetence. In fact, he was preceded by his son Namal, who has made several statements to the mainstream and social media, raising the issue as to why he was being called to the FCID or any such institution, while not acting on the increased spate of crime in the country.", "We must be aware of how much crime was hidden or covered up, during the regime of the now teary father and son, and their non-weeping uncles. The murder of Lasantha Wickramatunge, the \"missing\" case of Prageeth Ekneligoda, the so-called accident that killed Wasim Thajudeen, stands out in the MR- Namal- Gota period of unsolved crimes. There were numerous instances when the police arrested persons who were suspected to have committed one or more serious crimes, and killed them with police firing, while allegedly trying to escape while being transported by police to places they were supposed to show where weapons were hidden. Some, who made such escape attempts, or attempts to attack the armed police, were handcuffed. At least one such \"escaped\" person was drowned while handcuffed.", "Instead of these public tears what's needed today is for MR himself, to disclose to the people those corrupt and fraudulent persons whom he had admitted, at a temple, to have sheltered in his time. That was in the campaign for the January 8 poll. There could not be any sprats in that collection.

Nor is it common to write about one who had not made a noteworthy contribution in politics, arts, academia, religion, sports, or in any other public sphere. Yet, there are gems of human beings, unsung and unheard, whose qualities are far more worthy of praise than the prominent personages whose lives are publicly celebrated. Sena Gunawardena is one such person, one of an ever diminishing tribe of honest, decent and caring human beings.", "I first met Sena back in 1967 when he joined the State Engineering Corporation (SEC) as a Personnel Assistant. SEC, in those early years of its existence, and under the enlightened tutelage of Dr A N S Kulasinghe, was a dynamic institution manned by men and women in their early youth. We all were looking with bright eyes to building a new Ceylon (as the country was called then).", "As a Personnel Assistant, Sena played a vital role in building bridges across the professional and social hierarchy of the employees. To him, an employee is a human being first, and last too. Sena cut through rank and status when dealing with any issue that came his way and looking at it from a human angle first and foremost and then only in organisational terms.", "To this day I wonder at how expertly he managed this egalitarian stand against the forces of arrogance stemming from those of professional standing and rank. It was Sena\u2019a unique ability to disarm, without offence, the superciliousness of those who expected their dictums followed through without question or challenge. It was the same when he confronted vociferous union leaders. He faced every daunting situation with a pleasant, jovial, manner that defused tensions and captivated the hearts of those affected.", "Human resources management and industrial relations were Sena\u2019s natural forte. His knowledge of labour laws was not founded on text books and statutes, but in natural justice of decency, equality, impartiality and objectivity. He was a skilful negotiator adept at handling and resolving any knotty problem or complex matter. Sena\u2019s composure never changed from that calm and determined demeanour. But most of all it was his charming and infectious smile which stood as his unique trademark. It was no wonder then, he was soon promoted as a Personnel Officer and later manager. From SEC, Sena moved to other state entities and then, finally, ended his career as a director in the State Plantations Corporation.", "Sena Gunawardena was a man of integrity. When many others around him engaged in corrupt practices, be it in outright thievery from public funds or couched in bogus niceties of business \u201centrepreneurship\u201d, Sena maintained his impeccable honesty. To be sure, he could have made his millions using his position or stooping to corrupt practices. But he walked tall and proud in his Bata shoes, when others who worked with him, later in life, whizzed pass in BMWs or Benz bought with tainted money. But Sena was never envious. He valued his integrity far more than the riches of the crooks.", "The death of Sena Gunawardena left a huge void in the lives of many who were close and dear to him, his wife Ira and son Vajira, foremost. His loving daughter, Ishani, predeceased him after a short illness, which was the emotional deathblow that finally carried him away. Sena suffered a debilitating illness for many years. But he endured its encumbering effects with equanimity, never allowing his family or friends to see the physical pain he was going through. It was the death of his daughter that eventually broke his heart irreparably and the will to live.", "It would not be complete if I do not mention the role played by Ira, his devoted and loving wife. Ira was a tower of strength Sena could rely on. His success as a gentle human being of the highest order was, undoubtedly, the support given by Ira. She was there for him always, taking care of Sena\u2019s every need in good times and bad times.", "Yes, for sure, there will never be a statue erected at a public square to honour Sena; no airport, no harbour, no road, will ever be named after him.

Yet she was willing to listen. She had the intelligence and foresight to seek advice from the right quarters. Her formidable leadership and her courage kept her in good stead, especially during the abortive coup of 1962 and the first JVP insurgency of 1971. (\"She was the only man in her Cabinet,\" one of her officials had remarked during the height of the insurgency.)", "The coup was the first ever attempt to overthrow a legally elected government in post-independence Sri Lanka. The conspirators were a group of disgruntled police and military officers that belonged to a generation, which was virtually alienated from Sri Lanka's history and traditions. Their objective was to turn the political clock back to the immediate post-independence years. The failure of the plot marked an important milestone in the country's national revival campaign, which also led to Sri Lanka becoming a republic in 1972.", "In 1970 her United Front Government's Cabinet had stalwarts like Dr. N.M. Perera, Dr Colvin R. de Silva, Pieter Keuneman, Felix Dias Bandaranaike and Maitripala Senanayake.", "Sunderalingam salutes Mrs. Bandaranaike as a far-seeing administrator for her unfailing support to the Police Department in setting up the Colombo Detective Bureau (CDB) to streamline and fine-tune crime investigation and crime control in the city, which was an unqualified success. Her participation in its inauguration in 1973 further boosted the CDB's image and prestige.", "She was fortunate to have become Head of State during the Cold War era - though a period of international tension - was favourable to small nations because of the balance of global power. The rivalry between the Soviet Union and the USA made it difficult for either power to manipulate political issues solely to its own advantage and exercise undue influence on less powerful states. The Cuban missile crisis was one example.", "Bandaranaike's mediation in the Sino-Indian border dispute in 1962 showed her courage even though she represented a small nation. Her contribution to the formation of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1964 proved that she was virtually equal in stature to such world leaders as Yugoslovia's Tito, India's Nehru and Egypt's Nasser.", "During her administration Sri Lanka was better known in the Socialist Bloc and NAM as the 'Bandaranaike country.' It was the time Sri Lanka reached the highest level of international recognition. The country benefited much from the Socialist Bloc countries like Soviet Union and China.", "Heavy industries like tyre, steel, textiles, sugar etc, made us a semi-industrial nation.", "The crowning glory of Bandaranaike's political career was when Sri Lanka hosted the Non-Aligned Summit in 1976 at the newly opened BMICH, a tribute the People's Republic of China paid to the Bandaranaike Family. I was doing the 'police beat' for the Ceylon Observer at the time of the summit and remember the tight security arrangements made for the event. On board the 'Galeb' President Tito's Yacht, the Yugoslav Navy geared itself to meet threats from any quarter. Anti-aircraft gun crews were on the alert for any unidentified aircraft violating Sri Lanka's airspace. In the Colombo Harbour frogmen were searching for possible mines planted by saboteurs. On the day of the banquet on board the 'Galeb' 700 Sri Lankan Policemen in mufti as well as in uniform were on duty.", "From Belgrade in 1964 to Colombo in 1976, Bandaranaike showed that foreign policy was the SLFP's forte. In 1974 she scored a diplomatic triumph when she secured the islet of Katchchativu for Sri Lanka through negotiations with the then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.", "In 1966 Sunderalingam was posted to Jaffna as SP North and remained there until December 1972.

It was decision which brought the farmers a very good income, though the prices shot up and adversely affected consumers.", "The downside was the mistakes - including the imposition of rationing - made under the United Front Government's closed economic policy, especially after the oil crisis of 1973.

There are pros and cons of this move, which has seen the prices of these vehicles go up between Rs.600,000 to Rs.1.2 million, not counting the effects of currency fluctuations.", "With more than 70,000 vehicles of all types entering the roads every month, our road network is at breaking point especially in the Western Province where most of the vehicles are registered. From the authorities' point of view, a measure of control over the vehicle population is desirable. One also has to take into consideration the revenue imperatives of the Government, because these taxes are used for many aspects of development. Another possible benefit is that the new taxes will encourage the import of mostly brand new vehicles, because the consumer price difference between reconditioned and new cars will be minimal. In other words, it will no longer be profitable to import older cars well past their prime.", "But at the same time, one has to respect the right of all citizens to purchase a motor vehicle in a democracy. When income levels go up, people naturally want to climb up the social ladder and a vehicle is one of those goals. The other reason that everyone aspires to buy a vehicle is the notoriously unreliable nature of the public transport system in this country. It is a nightmare to travel by bus or train in the morning/evening rush hour and most people opt to buy at least a motorcycle to get to their workplaces and run other errands on time.", "Rather than imposing ad-hoc taxes, the time has come to take stock of the big picture of vehicle imports and usage in this country. Imposing more taxes on vehicles, especially hybrids, could be counter-productive in the long run. After all, duty concessions were granted for these vehicles because they could run more kilometres per litre of fuel and thus save foreign exchange spent on fuel imports. With the proposed duty increase, the authorities run the risk of driving people away from hybrids, especially in instances where an equivalent petrol-only model is available. The Mitsubishi Outlander is a perfect example - under the new duty system, the plug-in hybrid version will cost at least Rs.3 million more than the petrol version. This almost amounts to punishing the customer for opting for a more environmentally-friendly, less fuel consuming vehicle. One would rather pump fuel with that Rs.3 million - which ultimately defeats the whole purpose of popularizing hybrids. The authorities should therefore re-think the duties and taxes on hybrids.", "Ad-hoc tax changes have another negative effect - when the taxes are lowered, private car importers get into a frenzy and import thousands of cars at once. Each so-called 'car-sale' has hundreds of cars awaiting customers and despite having so many cars in stock, they import even more units, which results in a foreign exchange crunch. The authorities should formulate a mechanism to ensure that excess numbers of cars are not imported. There should be an application and inspection procedure which ensures that an importer cannot import new units of a particular model if he already has unsold units of the same model. The 'car sale' model is not economically sustainable in the long run as it is basically an uncontrollable juggernaut at present. On the other hand, sole agents bring down cars strictly on the orders they receive, apart from a few display and demonstrator models. That is a more economically viable system.", "In the end, it is much better to have a uniform tax policy for vehicles for at least five years at one stretch, which generally tempers the demand and regulates the influx of vehicles. In the days when taxes and duties on all petrol vehicles amounted to a blanket 100 percent on all engine sizes, there was hardly a surge in imports unlike now when importers try to \"make hay while the sun shines\".", "To give praise where it is due, the authorities rightly deserve plaudits for lowering the duty on all-electric cars to just 5 percent, which was a move in the right direction. We hope this will continue without an interruption. Again, this good move will be negated if all these cars draw electricity from the National Grid which is fed mostly by fossil fuels. The Government must grant duty free concessions for rapid DC chargers and solar charging stations, which will lessen the dependence on fossil duel generated mains electricity.", "The authorities were also right to lower duties on 1000 CC or less cars through the last budget, but they are still way too high at around 155 percent. These cars' fuel efficiency levels are almost on par with those of hybrids. If these cars are made more affordable, there is every possibility of three wheelers - those totally unsafe contraptions - going off the road for good. That in itself will be a major achievement of a more enlightened vehicle import policy which is sorely needed at this juncture.\u00a0"]},

Once a human or other animal dies, its DNA starts to fall apart. Bacteria swiftly colonise the corpse, overwhelming it with their own DNA.", "But by the 1990s scientists were beginning to retrieve fragments of DNA and piece them together into longer segments. In 2010, researchers assembled the genome of a Neanderthal from 38,000-year-old fossils from Croatia.", "In many other cases, researchers failed to find ancient DNA in human fossils. Because it was widely suspected that the heat and humidity in the tropics would destroy genetic material, many scientists flocked to places like Siberia to search for ancient DNA.", "That skepticism proved to be unwarranted. In recent years, Ron Pinhasi, an archaeologist at University College Dublin, and his colleagues have been surveying different bones to see if any are particularly good for preserving DNA. They found that the bone surrounding the inner ear can hold an abundance of genetic material even when other bones have lost theirs.", "As they reported last year, the scientists were able to pull out genomes from the ear bones of hundreds of Europeans who lived thousands of years ago. Their success gave them hope that they might be able to rescue ancient DNA from African skeletons as well.", "They got their chance when John Arthur and Kathryn Weedman Arthur, archaeologists at the University of South Florida, and their colleagues uncovered the skeleton of a man in the Mota cave, in the highlands of southern Ethiopia. Mota, as the scientists refer to the man, was laid out in a ceremonial burial. His head rested on a pillow-like stone, his hands were folded under his body, and he was surrounded by stone tools.", "The researchers sent Dr Pinhasi a sample of the inner ear bone, hoping that he and his colleagues could fish out some DNA. They succeeded spectacularly, extracting enough DNA to reconstruct Mota's entire genome.", "Dr Pinhasi and his colleagues also got some clues about what Mota was like by looking at some of his genes. He was probably brown-skinned and had brown eyes, for example.

Following the conclusion of Jayawardene's 149-match Test career during the last home series against Pakistan, Sangakkara retired from Tests after the first two Tests in the last home series against India. Now that both Jayawardene and Sangakkara, who had done bulk of the scoring in recent times, have retired it would be a heavy burden on skipper Angelo Mathews in marshalling his brigade during the team-building process.", "Tillakaratne's patience at the middle as a dependable Test batsman has been a shining example, scoring 4,545 runs with an attractive average of 42.87 in 83 matches with 11 centuries and 20 fifties. At a time Sri Lanka is struggling to groom a good set of top and middle order batsman, an experienced campaigner such as Tillakaratne could play a vital role.", "But it all depends on how transparent the SLC Interim Committee would be when picking the \u2018right people for the right job'! Petty club politics should be a thing of the past, giving the highest priority to build a strong national team to fill the vacuum. It would not be an easy task to find a middle order pair which could emulate Mahela and Sanga and their absence would be badly felt. Yet, Sri Lanka must make every effort to find batsmen who could somewhere get closer to their exemplary careers.", "Going by the recent performance records, Sri Lanka may once again opt for a professional foreign coach. Yet, past Sri Lanka cricketers with proven track records could be used to development specialized areas such as batting, fast bowling, spin bowling and fielding. It was unfortunate that Sri Lanka has not continued with its fast bowling coach Chaminda Vaas who had captured 355 Test wickets and 400 ODI wickets with his \u2018left-arm fast bowling'.", "During the rare break he got to coach seamers of New Zealand team, Vaas produced instant results that prompted local cricket authorities to sign him. But the manner in which he was unceremoniously dumped with various excuses should not be approved and Tillakaratne too should not be treated in similar fashion.", "The services of the most outstanding former Sri Lanka cricketers such as Vaas and Tillkaratne should be used in the most profitable manner to sharpen the skills of the national team. This could be done under the overall supervision of a foreign head coach. Had Marvan Atapattu teamed up well with Vaas, Sri Lanka would never have lost successive home series which eventually compelled the former Sri Lanka opening batsman to step down from his position as the head coach.", "The West Indies have just begun their full tour of Sri Lanka although the hosts are still in search of a permanent coach. SLC's head of coaching Jerome Jayaratne, who does not have any intentional experience as a player, is now functioning as the interim head coach appointed by the interim committee. His interim appointment came merely four days after Atapattu had tendered his resignation as the national team coach after Pakistanis and Indians had beaten us on home soil.", "Although Jayaratne was appointed the head of coaching in 2008, his role was not extended to the national team which was then coached by Trevor Bayliss.

But the SLC finally settled for Atapattu, a decision which had been criticized by certain quarters.The premature exits of Farbrace and his successor Atapattu have forced Sri Lanka cricket administrators to do \u201ccoach shopping\u201d once again.", "Whilst accepting that Sri Lanka has \u201cfallen behind\u201d in Test cricket, the interim head coach Jayaratne has said the team is working hard to correct that during the upcoming home series against West Indies. Sri Lanka have lost their last three Test series, against New Zealand away and then to Pakistan and India at home, winning two and losing six out of eight games and Jayaratne will face a gigantic task in putting the house back in order. Although Jayaratne expects an improved performance against West Indies, it would not be an easy task for Angelo's lads to come on top.", "Batting and ground fielding are two areas that cost Sri Lanka its last two series against Pakistan and India. In the absence of a batting coach, a role that was fulfilled by Atapattu, Jayaratne has taken on the task for the time being. Jayaratne has said he is also keen on keeping the team atmosphere good, and has instructed the players to come to him if they are not comfortable.", "The West Indies too have their own worries to address. West Indies captain Jason Holder has said that the fate of suspended head coach Phil Simmons lay in the hands of West Indian board but added that he had been a \u201cwonderful inspiration\u201d during his brief time in charge.", "Simmons\u2019 position was put in limbo when he expressed discontent over West Indies\u2019 ODI squad for the tour of Sri Lanka. However, Holder hopes for a swift resolution that would allow Simmons to return to the squad in Sri Lanka. Though Simmons has apologized for his controversial remarks, he was asked to answer for \u201cbreaches of confidentiality\u201d by the WICB and is currently awaiting an HR hearing.", "The untimely suspension of Simmons has posed a significant problem for West Indies, coming as it did only days before the squad was scheduled to assemble in Sri Lanka. Simmons was appointed West Indies coach in March and the Sri Lanka tour would have been his first international foray with the outfit. Interestingly, the two-Test series against Sri Lanka will be Holder's first assignment as captain. Undoubtedly, Simmons\u2019 suspension is a setback for the West Indies.", "Skipper Holder would make every effort to create history on debut to add salt to Sri Lanka's wounds after hat-trick of Test series defeats at the hands of New Zealand, Pakistan and India.

It\u2019s worst in America where, between the 1980s and 2000s, the proportion of people who said they had a good work friend slid from half to less than a third. But the situation\u2019s hardly wonderful in Britain, where 42% of us don\u2019t. It\u2019s easy to guess why. Once, we had jobs for life, which meant colleagues for life, plus company events for the family.", "Now, writes Grant, \u201cwork is a more transactional place. We go to the office to be efficient, not to form bonds.\u201d Transience \u2013 along with telecommuting and extreme busy-ness \u2013 is poison to friendship. The guy at the desk next to yours might be gone in two months. Or you might be gone. Or, if you\u2019re a victim of the sinister cult of hot-desking, you might not even have a desk. Why bother asking him to the pub?", "This might not matter if we were also spending fewer hours at work, with time to forge friendships outside, but the opposite\u2019s true, of course, which means the worst of both worlds: more work, with\u00a0less social nourishment to show for it. And\u00a0friendships sown in office soil were fragile shoots to begin with, as Mark Vernon explains in his lovely book, The Meaning Of Friendship, because the logic of the workplace is opposed to that of making friends.", "Work is about getting things done, so your value\u2019s inevitably linked to what you contribute. A close friendship, by contrast, is valuable precisely because it\u2019s not transactional, in any measurable way. It\u2019s a\u00a0commitment to be there regardless.

It was the next step that turned out to be the hardest of them all. Buying seeds. When I called the Department of Agriculture and asked if they had vegetable seeds for me to buy for my backyard vegetable garden, the person at the other end of the line said, I should talk to some other person about it. I was given another number to call. When I dialed this number every few seconds for about thirty minutes I kept hearing the engaged tone. Finally when the phone rang I was told the person I was supposed to talk to was on another call. But thankfully, before the person-I-was-not-supposed-to-talk-to hung up, I managed to blurt my question to her. Which was so very simple. Can I buy vegetable seeds from their department?

Hence, we sell young plants in Sri Lanka, that give flowers in a few weeks. This means they are 6 to 8 weeks from seed stage when we sell them,\u201d wrote Rajapakse.", "Yet, what he said, did nothing to solve my problem.

They did not say. So, I decided, I would fill the containers with ordinary garden soil and keep my fingers crossed. For, no matter what, it\u2019s a universal truth that nothing is perfect, and, not every seed will germinate, anyway.", "It was useful to know though, that large seeds that can be easily handled could be placed individually in the mix. Smaller seeds can be sown by snipping off a corner of the seed packet and tapping them gently out of the packet as you sow them. If too many seeds fall out at once, you should gently spread them with the tip of a pencil. Seeds need room to grow, so, be careful not to plant them too thickly. Place two large seeds and two to three small seeds in each container where you want at least one plant to grow.", "Check the directions to see if the seeds need light or dark to germinate, said the experts. Those that need light should not be covered with the soil mix, but should be pressed down (not buried) so that they make contact with the moist medium. Those that need dark should be lightly covered with the mix (about 1 to 2 times the seed thickness) and can be placed in a dark place or covered with black plastic or something else that will keep the light out.", "I confess at this point, I gave up reading.

They have successfully demonstrated the viability of rainwater harvesting in the Vavunia area where 750 households depend entirely on rainwater for drinking and cooking throughout the year. Several schools in the Kilinochchi and Batticaloa districts have been provided 30,000 liter capacity rainwater storage tanks. Despite such living proof of the viability of this simple, common sense, \u2018low tech\u2019 home-grown, solution which provides rural households with potable water at their door step, government agencies and vested interests are promoting high cost imported filters (R.O. systems) which cost the beneficiaries (poor villagers) four times more per liter of purified water, besides requiring them to collect their daily water requirements from a central location. Farmers too are busy people with little time to waste in making daily expeditions to water distribution points.", "An effective community health education programme designed to inform rural households on the importance of drinking adequate quantities of water (at least 3 liters/adult/day); refraining from smoking, intake of illicit brews (Kassippu), avoiding self medication by rushing to the nearest pharmacy or village \u2018Kade\u2019 to purchase strong analgesics (pain killers) for relief of common body aches and pains, and overall improved nutrition is a vital need for residents in CKDu endemic areas.

Almost unconsciously, one changes sides to play a new role cheating every body around.

Applications may be called from people who have a little bit of knowledge on agriculture pursuits for alienation of lands from selected suitable areas.

If I want to crank it, I do it there. But I come here because it's great for the kids, and because of the people.\"", "Given its trading past, eastern Sri Lanka has evolved into a blend of populations. En route to one surf lesson, our tuk tuk contained a Christian Tamil surf coach, his Buddhist assistant and this foreigner, all being driven by a Muslim. Still, it was Australians who first discovered the waves in Sri Lanka and started to surf there regularly. Jaya Dissa, a tuk tuk driver, recalls his amazement when he saw his first \"white guys,\" back in 1971. As a 10-year-old, he tagged along wherever they went. The local boys used to bodysurf, and the fishermen knew all the breaks. But they hadn't seen surfboards before. \"I used to give them coconuts, whatever I can find, and then ask to have a ride on their board,\" Dissa, now 54, said. He became one of the best local surfers, but he left during the war, returning home only three years ago. \"Now I don't have the lungs or power for it.\"Surfing in Sri Lanka is surprisingly seasonal. The monsoons bring rain to one side of the island while the other is dry. The resulting tides shift the sand throughout the year, so what once was a surf break gets washed away, only for the sand bank to build back up the following season.", "Most of the Arugam Bay surf instructors teach for only half the year. The rest of the time they revert to catching tuna.", "They may make more money fishing with their fathers, but to a man (and in a culturally conservative country, the surf coaches still are all men) they say they vastly prefer teaching newbies. \"I'm making friends, that's what I love about surfing,\" Anthrasa, the Amigo instructor, said. \"I love my job, and I'm having the most fun ever.\"", "By the end of our trip we could, more or less, catch our own waves. Max decided he could dedicate his life to the sport.

We have had many Police Commissions at various times but there is today a need for the government to re-appoint a multi-disciplinary team to study the problem afresh. It appears to us that there has been a breakdown in relations between the community and the Police. This is an absolutely vital area that we should examine. We can draw from the experience of many countries which have adopted Community Policing practices. I believe that a unit of the Defence Ministry which was headed by Dr. Sanjay Colonne did an in-depth study of this issue but with the change of government in January of this year that unit was disbanded.", "To my mind whilst this is a good beginning it is wholly inadequate. In Japan for instance they assign two or three policemen to a particular area so that they become familiar with the residents and the residents with them, as a way of reducing crime.", "Community policing, or community-oriented policing, is a strategy of policing that focuses on police building ties and working closely with members of the communities.", "In published texts Community Policing is described as \u201ca philosophy that promotes organizational strategies, which support the systematic use of partnerships and problem-solving techniques, to proactively address the immediate conditions that give rise to public safety issues such as crime, social disorder, and fear of crime\u201d. There is no universally accepted definition of Community Policing however it can commonly be described as a policy that requires police to inherit a proactive approach to address public safety concerns.", "This type of policing has been utilized in various cities for about the last 150 years. The first form of community oriented policing is credited to the London Metro Police Department around 1830, as regular patrol areas were assigned to officers, now commonly known as \u201cbeats\u201d. Community-oriented policing was a cornerstone of the Clinton administration and gained its funding from the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act (Ahlin, Gibbs). According to a survey conducted by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) of more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies that had been using community policing for at least one year, 62 percent stated they had less crimes committed against civilians, 80 percent stated that they had reduced the fear of crime, and 99 percent stated that they had received increased cooperation from civilians. The overall assessment of community oriented policing is positive, as officers and community members both attest to its effectiveness in reducing crime and raising the sense of security in a community.", "\"Community policing is a philosophy of full service personalized policing, where the same officer patrols and works in the same area on a permanent basis, from a decentralized place, working in a proactive partnership with citizens to identify and solve problems.\"", "According to Bertus Ferreira, an authority on the subject, \"Community policing is a professional management organization that is structure for the support in the community to create proactive problem solving to address the immediate conditions that give rise to the public safety issues such as crime, social disorder and fear of crime.", "Community policing has partnerships between law enforcement agency and other organizations like government agencies, community members, nonprofit service providers, private businesses and the media. Government agencies includes probation and parole, public works departments, neighbouring law enforcement agencies, health and human services, child support services, ordinance enforcement, and schools. Community members can include partnerships with neighbourhood association that has meetings, town hall meetings and storefronts decentralized in the community. Nonprofit organizations includes advocacy of groups like service clubs, support groups, issue groups and community development corporations. These groups work with individuals that have the same interest in the community.", "Private businesses have a bigger impact on the community from the health perspective. Private businesses often identify problems that provide the resources which can include security technology for the community. The media represents a powerful organ to communicate with the community. The community policing uses the media to assist with publicizing concerns and solutions that will impact the community. The media can have an impact on the fear of crime, crime problems and perceptions of the police in the community. Community policing recognizes that police can\u2019t solve every public safety problem alone so interactive partnerships are involved. The policing uses the public for developing problem solving solutions.", "The contemporary community policing movement emphasizes changing the role of law enforcement from a static, reactive, incident-driven bureaucracy to a more dynamic, open, quality-oriented partnership with the community. Community policing philosophy emphasizes that police officers work closely with local citizens and community agencies in designing and implementing a variety of crime prevention strategies and problem-solving measures. To accomplish these initiatives, it is crucial that officers feel closely integrated with the majority of citizens and agencies in the community they serve. Typically, this means that officers perceive themselves as sharing important community values, beliefs, and goals. It also implies that officers are confident of community support and involvement in their decisions and action\".", "Many common elements in community-oriented policing include:", "* Relying on community-based crime prevention by utilizing civilian education, neighbourhood watch, and a variety of other techniques, as opposed to relying solely on police patrols.", "* Re-structuralizing of patrol from an emergency response based system to emphasizing proactive techniques such as foot patrol.", "* Increased officer accountability to civilians they are supposed to serve.", "* Decentralizing the police authority, allowing more discretion amongst lower-ranking officers, and more initiative expected from them.", "I do hope that the government would appoint a special Commission to look into the state of the Police Service today; meanwhile I presume that the Police Commission would be established under the 19th Amendment in the very near future and persons such as the Dr. Sanjay Colonne, who was involved with this subject when he was serving with the Defence Ministry, and retired respected IGPs and retired DIGs would be appointed to this Commission and would work to restore the image of the Service.\u00a0"]},

Which of our spinners will be Doosath? These are the questions that haunt spinners in the world and especially Sri Lanka where it was made a fine art. That the dreaded 'DOOSRA' AKA the one that goes the other way, was a delivery invented by former Pakistani off spinner Saqlain Mushtaq and made a fine art by Sri Lanka's off spinner Muttiah Muralitharan. That an illegal action is required to bowl it is old hat now.", "The latest bowler to fall foul and be penalized for bowling the 'DOOSRA' with an illegal action is Sri Lanka's promising offie Tharindu Kaushal.

Then Muralitheran learned the ropes and baffled batsmen by fine tuning it to be his main wicket taking weapon and when he bowled it, it was always a wicket taking delivery and most of his 800 wickets came off the 'DOOSRA.", "The 'DOOSRA' is a delivery bowled with an off break action which pitches and instead of turning in like a normal off break, viciously spins and goes the other way fooling the best of batsmen who play imagining it is an off break and falling prey.", "With off spinners dominating with this delivery and making batsmen succumb, it was not long when batsmen suspected and complained that the 'DOOSRA' was being delivered with an illegal action that looked to be more of a throw which forced umpires to have a close look and complain.", "It was later discovered that for the 'DOOSRA' to be bowled it requires an illegal action and when Ajmal, Narine and Senanayake delivered umpires reported and tests proved that the bowlers were delivering with illegal actions.", "All three bowlers needed correction and when they came back to the big game, they were never the menacing bowlers they were before being tested and corrected. They had lost their viciousness, looked ordinary and it was sad to see them dropped from their national teams.", "The Pakistanis have dumped their number one spinner Saeed Ajmal who spun them to many memorable and exciting victories saying that he is not the bowler that he was before having his action corrected. Pity because he was such a wonderful sight to watch when spinning and having batters in a flat spin.", "To the West Indies- Sri Lanka series and it is encouraging and interesting to note that the Windies selectors headed by that 'super cat' Clive Lloyd have reposed their confidence in Sunil Narine and slotted him into their one-day squad. It will be interesting to see how he goes. Offies Nathan Lyon and Moeen Ali don't bowl the 'DOOSRA'.", "Using the phrase - how he goes - brings to mind an amusing anecdote.

The international regime representative of the entities shown earlier quite struggles to cope.", "A Group of Global Experts have prepared a submission for the session on IDPs and is reflective of the urgent call for greater global institutional leadership. The key points are:", "1) Higher priority among national governments, international organizations and donors to IDPs as a population of special concern during conflict. While there has been great progress since the promulgation of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, there are still problems in gaining access to IDPs during conflict, which presents barriers to delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance.", "There are also far too many IDPs who have been displaced for decades, often living in camps or with little access to mainstream services in urban areas. The SG's report can reinforce that concerted effort on the part of the entire international community is needed to address these problems: to ensure access to all IDPs and to find solutions for IDPs as soon as is practicable. Setting goals of a) increasing the proportion of IDPs with access to assistance and protection by 50%, and b) reducing the number of IDPs in protracted situations by 50% could be an effective way to raise visibility of these issues.", "2) Institutional reforms to enhance the protection of IDPs both in situations of armed conflict and disasters. Many at the workshop noted need for a 'visible face' for the protection of IDPs. Whether because of the downgrading of the position of Special Representative to Special Rapporteur or because of the limits of the strictly human rights approach, there appears to be a vacuum of leadership in bringing attention to the needs of IDPs. At the same time, the cluster system has improved responses in many humanitarian crises but protection of IDPs remains a weak link in the response system.", "UNHRC's willingness to lead the protection cluster for conflict IDPs is welcome but UNHRC faces numerous barriers to its ability to fulfill its responsibilities. These include its lack of a clear mandate regarding IDPs (as compared to its strong mandate regarding refugees), inadequate financial support from donors for its work on IDPs, and security constraints in reaching IDPs as well as other conflict affected populations. The problems UNHRC faces are compounded by the weak role that some humanitarian coordinators play with regard to protection of IDPs.", "The Secretary-General in his report should recognize the important role that the humanitarian coordinators and the protection cluster could play with adequate support and pledge that he will make serious efforts to strengthen their activities in this area or make changes in the institutional architecture. The report should also call on donors to increase the funding that they provide for assistance and protection of IDPs and do so in a way that does not diminish their support for other vulnerable populations such as refugees. Finally, the report could urge that there be regular briefings or reports to the Security Council by the Emergency Relief Coordinator on barriers to access to IDPs and others at risk in their country and ways to overcome them.", "3) The Secretary-General should urge regional bodies to adopt declarations and conventions on IDPs, citing the Kampala Convention as a model and promote implementation of these instruments. He should also urge governments to adopt national laws and frameworks based on the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement and develop country strategies -- together with donor governments, international organizations, civil society and IDPs themselves -- to implement the agreed goals and work toward resolving displacement situations.", "4) Because displacement has many phases, including return, settlement and reintegration, the SG should strongly encourage an early role for development actors in conflict situations as well as an enhanced role for outside political actors, so that situations of mass displacement can be in part prevented or reduced and more effectively resolved. The report should prioritize efforts to support self-reliance and economic initiatives so IDPs do not need humanitarian assistance for prolonged periods. These initiatives should be undertaken in ways that support IDPs and host communities and involve, as much as possible, local governments and civil society organizations.", "As a particularly vulnerable population, the fate of IDPs rests with the strong commitment of the international community to work with governments to ensure adequate protection, assistance and solutions. The WHS is the perfect forum to reinvigorate the role of the international community in this regard.", "The Pope for example during his very recent visit to the US had to specifically make reference to climate change in his address to Congress. A forgotten dimension in definitions is the fact poverty is a disaster for those affected given an very uncertain existence every day whilst even farmers, fisherman also face seasonal disasters. Ultimately the menu of reasons bringing people together in Geneva and next year in Istanbul requires states to act within, collectively regionally, the UN system needs to be much more effective to stay relevant and global action requires Governments, corporates, non-profits and citizens to act in tandem. This is a tough act.\u00a0"]},

"], "posted_date": ["Wednesday, October 14, 2015 - 19:30"], "category": ["Features"], "author": [], "text": ["Are your own feelings easily bruised and do you worry endlessly about hurting other people's? Do you well up when watching charity adverts for illness or animal cruelty, dislike scary films or feel bothered by loud or irritating noises (think music coming from somebody's earphones) in a way that those around you don't? Then you could be a Highly Sensitive Person, or HSP, a condition that's common but until now rarely understood.", "However, this is all set to change. Awareness of HSPs has been gathering pace in the US for a while and a new documentary called Sensitive The Movie recently premiered in San Francisco. It explores the issue of HSP and features Dr Elaine Aron, a scientist and author ofThe Highly Sensitive Person (it's sold over a million copies). It also includes new research that shows how the region of the brain that deals with empathy and sensory information is different in people who score highly on the sensitivity scale.", "The singer Alanis Morissette, a self-confessed HSP, is among those who appear in the documentary. \"My temperament is highly sensitive. I'm very attuned to very subtle things, whether it's food or minerals or lighting or sounds or smells,\" she says. \"Overstimulation happens pretty easily.\"", "Rather than just being a personality type, like being shy or outgoing, being a HSP is defined as having a hypersensitive nervous system. As well as being easily overwhelmed by emotional things (they tend to have incredible empathy and get upset very easily), HSPs also have a Princess and The Pea-like sensitivity to physical things like lights, sounds, temperatures and even scratchy labels or certain fabrics.", "\"Being HS is genetic,\" says Dr Elaine Aron, who is a leading researcher in the field. \"Twenty percent of us are born with it and it affects both sexes equally. I explain the condition in four letters: DOES. D is for depth of processing, which is the key to the whole condition. They process everything around them very deeply. O is for overstimulation, which is brought about because of D. E is for emotional reactivity and empathy. Research shows HSPs respond more to the emotions of others and to situations in general. And S is for sensitive stimuli - they're incredibly sensitive to smells, sounds and light. However, not all HSPs are alike. For example, we know that around 30% are extroverts rather than introverts, which is what most people expect them to be.\"", "Dr Ted Zeff, a psychologist and author of The Highly Sensitive Person's Survival Guide, agrees. \"Every sensitive person is different,\" he says. \"It's also important to remember that some people have some of the traits, like empathy, but they're not HSPs.\"", "So what are the traits? Dr Zeff says people who are HS \"don't have a natural shield - they find it hard to tune stuff out. For example, somebody standing close behind them and peering over their shoulder will really unsettle a HSP.\" Dr Aron says HS men have a much harder time generally because society is less forgiving of them.", "As for a cure, however, Dr Zeff says there's no need. \"If you are a HSP you shouldn't want to 'cure' yourself. It's who you are. In certain societies being highly sensitive is seen as a positive thing. Research found that highly sensitive men in Thailand and India were rarely, if ever, teased, whereas highly sensitive men in North America were frequently so.\"", "HSPs, he believes, do best in nurturing environments and are more likely to be artists, musicians, teachers, counsellors and health practitioners. They're also likely to be popular because they're so in tune with the needs of others.", "So if heightened sensitivity doesn't need to be cured, how can those who have it manage, rather than be overwhelmed, by it? \"Most tend to develop coping mechanisms as they grow older and mature,\" says Dr Zeff. \"So while a 21-year-old HSP might feel peer pressured into going to a noisy club with friends, a 41-year-old will know what situations they can cope with and avoid those they can't.\"", "Because HSPs become easily overwhelmed, Dr Zeff says they need daily downtime. \"They shouldn't be ashamed of who they are, nor compare themselves to others,\" he adds. \"However, if you're in a relationship or part of a family or workplace there needs to be some compromise. For example, just because you don't like noise it doesn't mean everybody around you has to be quiet. Don't be what I call an 'insensitive highly sensitive person'! Just go into another room or go for a walk.\"", "As for highly sensitive children, Dr Aron says when they're raised with an awareness of their overactive nervous systems they'll thrive and get ahead socially because they have such great empathy and kindness. However, if they're constantly told off for crying or told to \"pull themselves together\" they may think something is wrong with them and become depressed, anxious and overly sensitive to criticism as they get older.", "\"The reason I wrote The Highly Sensitive Child is because so many adults wrote to me saying they wished their parents had understood their sensitivity rather than trying to stamp it out,\" she says.", "\"The good news is highly sensitive adults tend to respond well to therapy because they're so in touch with their emotions. But if they're raised in the right way in the first place, this group of people have so much to offer the world.\"\u00a0"]},

Agriculture growth leads to stable food security and greater income to manage risks of hunger and poverty.", "About 73 percent of the world population have no access to adequate social protection.

It is much larger issue that involves the whole food system and affects every one of us in some way .issues such as whether households get enough food, how it is distributed within the household and whether that food fulfils the nutritional needs of all members of the household show that food security is linked to health.", "Food security and nutrition is inter linked and cannot be separated. It directly affects the dietary energy supply of the population.", "Therefore food security can be described as a phenomenon relating to individuals. It is the nutritional status of household member that is ultimate focus. It is an inter grated system and includes every action from farm to table.", "The world has the resources and technology to eradicate hunger and ensure long term food security for all in spite of many challengers and risks through a 21st century GREEN REVOLUTION.", "It however needs a combined effort by everyone.

Senanayake have been in politics.", "\"I have always acted according to my conscience. My conscience and my instinct go together. It is very difficult sometimes in politics to do that, because you sometimes feel one way and you have to sometimes toe the party line. Then it is difficult. But I have always tried my best to act according to my conscience and it is always backed with my instincts. I think I have got into politics for the right reason. Which is, you try to do something for the people. Which is what I have really tried to do. And coupled with the fact that I have worked hard, I have become successful. Hard work is always a vital component to success,\" says the young politician.", "Vasantha has done his LLM degree at Kothalawala Defence University. At this point he is finishing his thesis and hopes to do his doctorate after that.", "\"My school years were very interesting. In our time technology was not so advanced. There were no mobile phones to text messages like what is happening today. What we used to do was write these long letters of love and poems. And in my letters I used to spray a little bit of cologne into my letters! It was the cologne I used to wear. So each time the letter was opened, the scent of cologne came out! So looking back it was quite funny. But children nowadays don't do silly things like that. But it was silly and romantic in its own way. A great meeting point those days were fairs and carnivals and places like the Liberty Plaza,\" he smiles.", "\"The girls came at a particular time and the boys would also come there and usually there was 'the girl's' mother who followed her.

It was a wide circle of people who knew each other. We were round about the same age, I was just one year older.\"", "Senanayake has faced many challenges in life. He feels that sometimes in politics you feel that you do not get the due recognition that you should have got. That is a constant factor that keeps coming out. He has often felt that he has been overlooked or ignored sometimes. But Vasantha maintains that in politics you can't let that affect you. You have to go on despite the fact that you think you do not get what you deserve. That does not mean that you should throw in the towel and quit. You have to continue, that is the reality of politics.", "Another challenge this young politician outlined, that is common to many, is to sit with people whose values are very different and try to work together. He feels that this is very hard when you have a certain set of principles and a set of values.", "In politics people think that you are a lot more powerful than you really are. This Vasantha feels is a drawback. As the State Minister today and as a Deputy Minister in the past, he knew the amount of things that he could do.

All this has to be done with a balance. Know your history, know your culture and then embrace what is from outside and blend it in a way that suits your culture and country.", "Senanayake admires the Buddha for the Dhamma he brought saying that Buddhism is a noble philosophy. Despite the fact that he is not a Christian, he is also inspired by the life and teachings of Christ. He also admires Geoffrey Bawa and David Paynter for their artistic brilliance.

Some of the other boxers Raymond produced are famous all-round sportsman Nimal Lewke now a retired DIG, who too was a stylish boxer and brought honor to the country at several meets locally and internationally and was adjudged the best boxer at national meets.

{"heading": ["Keep it simple! "], "posted_date": ["Wednesday, October 14, 2015 - 19:30"], "category": ["Features"], "author": ["Ishara Jayawardane"], "text": ["Building a house and moving into it, isn't as simple as you think. There is a whole dimension to it that those of us who aren't architects couldn't ever fathom. There is a psychological aspect to design that must be appreciated. It can change your lifestyle drastically. It can completely alter your future. Murad Ismail elaborated on this as only an architect could. A house does not become a home just by magic.", "\u201cI was in the second year of Architecture when a friend of mine approached me about designing a house for him. His income wasn't very large but as his wife owned a 10 or 15 perch property in Malabe and he had received an unexpected windfall, he asked me to build his house. My friend and his wife lived in a one room apartment that had a little counter with a sink & cooker and a few chairs. I built this house with the knowledge I had in terms of science.", "The house I designed for my friend & his wife was 1500 square feet. It had a garage, pantry, kitchen, a living room and two bedrooms. I didn't fully appreciate at the time, that when you upgrade a person's life, you have to consider his income, his lifestyle & daily routine.", "I soon noticed the new car in the garage at my friend's house together with new furniture in the living room and a new set of pantry cupboards. When I asked him about it he said that he had borrowed the money. With his large new house, my friend felt he had to keep up with \u2018Colombo Society'. He owed a lot of money to people and as a result I saw the whole family slowly deteriorating. I tried to help him with the little pocket money I made, but I failed. Eventually, my friend and his wife separated. And, I realized the one factor you cannot ignore is lifestyle. The client may be a multi- millionaire or somebody like my friend - but their lifestyle must be thought of.\u201d said Ismail.", "\u201cToday when I design a house, I do a lot of in- depth study and though sometimes, people may get fed up of it, understanding their lifestyle is important to me. That is why I say architecture can be a slow killer. It killed my friends\u2019 family and it also nearly killed them physically. In a space of one month he went from a very modest life to almost \u2018Colombo society'. His ideas were too extravagant. He lost his head completely, he borrowed and ran into big debts. That was a life lesson for me because to me it was the house that was his downfall. He & his wife were together for about 15 years. She was from respectable family and they were very happy together until this happened.\u201d", "Living the good life is something we all dream about but there has to be a plan. You need to get it exactly right. A good architect is indispensable. But even more important is an architect who is honest with you and tells you what exactly you should invest in. Not what is profitable to him/her.", "\u201cFor most people building a house in this country is your final goal. There are countries in the same financial situation like ours, where people like to rent. The more developed ones are happy to rent as well. But Sri Lanka is different. We like to invest in houses.", "In Sri Lanka, people feel they need to go to an architect or designer even to do a pantry. But once they start to invest the money in a house, they lose sight of the bigger picture because they want the house to be a \u2018dream house.\u2019 And that is a danger because what they need to actually look at is if they can live in it, without showing it off and then suffering after!", "Sometimes our consultants, in order to get the job, agree to whatever the client says. But all it takes, is for them to understand what style and class is. If it is as simple as possible, then it automatically has class.", "The first steps when it comes to designing or building a house, is to first sort out the internal special arrangements that suits the client which, makes the house unique. Sometimes once the house is built, having put all the stress and money into it, you may get bored with the space. How do you prevent that? If it feels the same in the morning, evening and in the night, then you will get bored with it. Whereas, if you play around with light and ventilation, and let the house correspond with you every time you walk in, then every day it will surprise you and you will not be bored with it.\u201d", "People first come with \u2018wants.\u2019 You have to start providing their \u2018needs\u2019 first. They will want the world, but they don't \u2018need\u2019 it.", "\u201cThere are people who love to stay at home. Some prefer the outdoors. Some like to watch movies and some don't. Some like to spend a lot of time with children. Sometimes, when I meet a client we are at loggerheads, but I will not change the architectural simplicity that I believe in.", "To learn more about him, we talk about his lifestyle and habits. e.g Does he like large bathrooms, does he watch a lot of movies or does he watch TV? What he does during the weekend and during the day? This way, you pick up these things. Sometimes when we build offices for lawyers, we have to pick up whether the wife is cool about a home office or if it is a problem. Either way, we still have to build the office. So we design it in a way where he doesn't have to walk across the bedroom to the office which, might cause friction with his wife. This is because lawyers work at night and meet people at late hours. They need to have their own space/place at home. So you have to manipulate where the office room is and do you make it a part of the house or make it completely private?\u201d", "Ismail pointed out that his usual clients want simplicity and houses that are spatial. Small properties and nice spaces without long corridors and cooped up places.", "The trends in exteriors is all about simplicity. If it is urban housing, they have absolutely blank facades you cannot even look into. No window looks out because you can look in. It is all internal, that is the trend that is going around.", "It has been the trend since the large properties of Colombo were sold into small properties. When it was larger properties your neighbor was always your aunt or your cousin. Then the generations became bigger and bigger and they had to divide the plots.", "Then you can't afford to live there, so you go abroad and sell it. So everything now is more internal looking.", "The trend now is to enjoy your land rather than the neighbor's house. It is simplified and it is walled in. It is not really looking out at the sunrise or the sunset or a view of the sea; it is more about living in your own enclosure where you get your light and ventilation.", "You don't mind the neighbor doing a 20 story building next to you, because you are within your space. When you take the whole exterior look of the house it is generally looking into your land rather than looking out. You get your light and ventilation from within your land.", "------", "The Blue - Italian restaurant at The Four seasons, Landaa Giravaru", "Following traditional Maldivian architectural principles and using indigenous materials and details that meld with the surroundings, Murad's design for the Landaa Giraavaru is characterized by a certain airiness, a lightness of form. The clean lines and high ceilings of his buildings open up to breathtaking views of sky and sea. In not detracting from their environment, they flow into it instead.", "In designing it, Murad wanted to treat each room as a domain in itself. \u201cIt's all about spatial progression,\u201d he says, explaining that he wanted guests to discover the island piece by piece rather than have it laid out before them in one swoop. \u201cI wanted them to just go back with an idea that there is more to experience.\u201d", "Of the three restaurants the hotel boasts, the Italian restaurant Blue, is Murad's personal favorite. Perched on the western tip of the island overlooking the two kilometer lagoon, Blue embraces the essence of the Maldives as the place where the ocean meets the sky. Serving contemporary Italian cuisine, its all-white furnishings look out into the endless blue skies and turquoise waters.", "-------", "When designing you need to be as simple as possible.", "You decide what you want and then decide how the outside comes to, to accommodate that.", "Architecture is not art. To me it is more scientific. It is understanding life and sociology", "--------", "A sizeable property within the heart of Colombo, this home gives its owners complete privacy as there is no view from the outside, but the home opens up inside to lush gardens and airy open verandahs and spaces. Designed to accommodate the family's lifestyle and varying hobbies, the home boasts of Murad's signature minimal structures and simple finishes.\u00a0"]},

As if in response to mounting public criticism about inaction against corruption, there are many investigations underway and hardly a day passes without a stalwart of the former administration making headlines for alleged misdeeds.", "Within the last week former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunga, former Minister Janaka Bandara Tennekoon, former Eastern Province Chief Minister Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan (Pillayan) were all brought before law enforcement authorities.", "All this is in keeping with the promises made by President Maithripala Sirisena during the Presidential election and the United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) which promised yahapaalanaya or good governance and a return to the rule of law during the general election. However, this drive to 'name and shame' alleged culprits is politically a double edged sword.", "The hiccups in the processes are quite evident. When former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunga and another senior official of the previous regime, Anusha Pelpita were granted bail, an explanation was called from Police as to why they were afforded that privilege.", "Elsewhere, D.M.S. Dissanayake, Senior Assistant Secretary in the Defence Ministry and the officer-in-charge of Civil Security has come under investigation over the controversy surrounding the Avant Garde Maritime Services Limited. Then there was feverish speculation in some sections of the media that there would be developments regarding massive amounts of money stashed away in a bank in Dubai, leading to a public denial by parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa.", "Clearly, it is no easy task to clean the Augean stables. On the one hand, the government is being accused of not doing enough, quickly enough, to institute action against wrongdoers. It has also been accused of being selective in its prosecutions, implying there was a political agenda underlying the targeted individuals.", "On the other hand, the government is also hamstrung by several factors: in keeping with the tenets of good governance that it preached, it has to adopt a 'hands off' approach to the prosecution process, allowing the law to take its course. This may at times not yield the expected results. A case in point was the investigation into Kumaran Pathmanathan, better known as 'KP', financier to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and a most wanted man. The Attorney General was to inform courts that, despite his chequered history, there was no evidence against him to justify a prosecution!", "There may be legal technicalities that led to this conclusion, but a government which came into power comparing the fates of KP (being mollycoddled by the Mahinda Rajapaksa government) and Sarath Fonseka (jailed during the Rajapaksa era) now finds that it cannot prosecute a man with known terrorist credentials.", "Ministers have also expressed their displeasure about senior officials in the state bureaucracy. Most of these officials attained their position during the previous government and were beholden to their political masters to ensure that they kept their jobs, in keeping with the political culture of that time.", "When the Sirisena government took office in January, while there was much reshuffling, there was no mass scale purge of state officials.", "When questioned about this, President Sirisena reportedly said that if all officials loyal to the Rajapaksa regime were to be dismissed, there would be no one left! Now though, the government is encountering obstacles in implementing its policies and investigating its predecessors because these officials are either hampering inquiries or creating difficulties for the new administration.", "There were reports that an official of the Defence Ministry was a stumbling block in the Avant Garde inquiry. Similarly, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was perturbed by the pronouncements of our envoy in Geneva during the recently concluded sessions of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and had to intervene personally. These are just two instances where officials whose loyalties still lie with the previous regime are believed to have been 'difficult'.", "Another obstacle encountered by the government is its own composition. Because the UNFGG did not win an absolute majority at the August general election, it was compelled to form a 'national government' with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) of which the leader is President Sirisena.", "Although the UNFGG could have cobbled together a coalition either with the support of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) or by obtaining the support of a handful of SLFPers (both of which were reportedly forthcoming), both President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe were keen on pursuing the national government option, with an eye on introducing key constitutional reforms that would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.", "This political marriage of convenience has however led to snags primarily because it has allowed the stalwarts of the previous administration to gain ministerial and deputy ministerial status, while still having allegations of corruption and abuse of power against them.", "These individuals have been accommodated either because they were known as Rajapaksa loyalists and their allegiance has been sought to strengthen the President's grip on the SLFP or because they command significant support at the electorate level, despite the charges pending against them.", "Although the President has publicly pledged that investigations against these individuals would continue, this is easier said than done. Officials conducting investigations are in a quandary and fear consequences because their 'targets' are presently holding office.", "This is hampering the investigation process, because the country's bureaucracy still subscribes to a culture of serving the political masters of the day instead of acting independently.", "President Sirisena must also be mindful that, despite the power he wields as Executive President, his hold on his own party, the SLFP, will be constantly put to the test by Rajapaksa. For now, the former President is content to maintain a low profile as a parliamentarian for the Kurunegala district, resorting only to releasing the occasional press statement, as he did on the UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka.", "But there is little doubt that given half a chance, Rajapaksa will not hesitate to seize the initiative and attempt to wrest control of the party. Hence, President Sirisena has the unenviable tasks of co-habiting with a United National Party led government, keeping his own party men happy lest they desert to Rajapaksa's fold and at the same time honouring his election promises of punishing those guilty of corruption and abuse of power.", "The latter is also not an issue that could be resolved with the prosecution of a handful of cases. There are many politicians who have earned a reputation for being corrupt and the unrelenting exposure in the media - including social media which has proved crucial in recent times - demands that all of them be dealt with, especially if they continue to represent the masses in the country's legislature.", "So, it is a saga that will continue for some time to come. In the meantime, the government has a few short term challenges to overcome. Its first 'proper' budget is due in a few weeks. Local Government elections are scheduled for March next year.", "Through all this, the 'national' government is tasked with providing a stable administration while at the same time prosecuting wrongdoers without fear or favour. Indeed, the polls in March might provide an indicator as to how the general public rates the major parties in the performance of these responsibilities.\u00a0"]},
